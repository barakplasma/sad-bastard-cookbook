  <p>It takes a village to write a cookbook. We want to thank the following people
who suggested recipes, beta read and tested meals, and supported us during
the book-making process.</p>
<p>Special thank you to Rohan O’Duill, who assisted us as both an author and
a professional chef, despite his abject horror at most of the recipes in this
book. This isn’t the kind of food he cooks in his kitchen, but he still managed
to make the recipes both simpler and tastier. We couldn’t have written this
book without him.</p>
<p>To Nicole Northwood, fixer of words, contributor of recipes, marketing
expert, and mentor in the intimidating world of publishing. The fact that this
book is in your hands shows what a kick-ass teacher she is.</p>
<p>To our editors. Victoria Rose (Flickering Words) and Lindsay Hobbs (Topaz
Literary) saw our project and asked us if we needed editors—simply because
they believed in what we were trying to create. The best part of working
with Victoria was having an editor with high-level cooking expertise. She
knew what we were trying to express, so she was able to edit for clarity of
cooking instructions, as well as for language errors. Lindsay formatted all
our headings, subheadings, and footnotes so they had consistent styles,
turning our ramblings into a structured book. Both were able to see our
errors when repetition meant the words on the page no longer possessed
meaning to our very tired eyes. We are so immensely grateful, both for the
invaluable edits but also the vote of confidence in our work from the offer
itself.</p>
<p>To Rysz Merey, excellent friend and supremely dedicated formatter. We
thought turning this cookbook into an epub was the Kobayashi Maru
scenario of layout, but you managed to cut through the Gordian Knot, to mix
our metaphors like we’d mix a pot of soup.</p>
<p>To our tireless team of proofreaders: Anna Borisovskaya, Emma Berglund,
Nicole Northwood, and Rysz Merey. Your eyes were so helpful, especially
after we pulled all nighters and couldn’t read our own words anymore.</p>
<p>To the many people who contributed recipes, and to our tireless beta testing
team, who turned this from a series of jokes into workable instructions. Anna
Borisovskaya, china shop, CJ Mantel, Clare, Emma Berglund, Eric Hortop,
Fallopia Tuba, Franklin P. Smearcase, Gretchen McSomething, Holly, IJ Barry,
Kayt Kismet, Lcohen, Lindsay Hobbs, Naomi, Naraht, Nye, omniamutantur,
Rachel Corsini, Raye Frenzy, Renee Carignan, Sabitha Furiosa, Shannon
Massey, S. M. Berry, Sun Salute, Tetsab, Tim &amp; Rachel, Val, and Vicki
Rosenzweig. And to the anonymous contributors, who are just as wonderful
as the rest but much more mysterious.</p>
<p>To Reccia Mandelcorn, for agreeing to a last-minute pickle photoshoot.</p>
<p>To our Discord servers, who are endlessly loved and loving. <em>Night Beets</em> , <em>The
Spicy Pepper (the Joy/Sad Unit)</em> , <em>Cats and Eldritch Horrors</em> , and <em>LGBTQIA+ Critique
Group.</em> And thank you to the many people who supported our vision along
the way. If you marked the book as “to read” on Goodreads, offered us
an encouraging word on a Discord server, e-mailed to say that you knew
someone this book would help—that it might help you—we are so grateful.</p>
<p>And last but never least, to the many cats who contributed to this book,
whether by screaming, walking over keyboards, or emotional support. All
cats are beautiful, but you are the best.</p>
