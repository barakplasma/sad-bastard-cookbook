One promises to have you eating\nhealthy, another as your ancient ancestors did, a third to\ndemystify foam. This cookbook isn’t like that.\nThis cookbook is an old friend who keeps crashing on your\ncouch, promising they’ve got something lined up and are gonna\nget their shit together. This cookbook is all the recipes you\nalready make, when you’ve worked a 16-hour day, when you can’t stop\ncrying and you don’t know why, when the eldritch abomination you woke at\nthe bottom of the ocean won’t go back to sleep. And hopefully, this cookbook\ngives you some new meal ideas. Even Sad Bastards have to eat.\nWe promise these recipes are:\n\n\nSimple. Like, add boiling water and eat simple. We don’t care if you can’t\nmaintain focus. You are the target audience for this cookbook. There are\noptions for Next Level cooking, going up to God-Tier difficulty for the\nbest-worst days, but there’s also Peanut Butter on a Spoon for the worst-\nworst days.\n\n\nIngredients which (mostly) don’t go bad. We see you. Maybe you’re too\nbusy to keep up with the groceries, maybe you’re just too depressed.\nTreat yourself to a meal with fresh vegetables on grocery day! But people\nwho shop mostly in the canned, dried, and frozen food aisles can go a lot\nlonger between grocery runs.\n\n\nCheap. The Boomers destroyed the economy. Sorry to any\nBoomers reading this. We don’t like that you did it either.\n#NotAllBoomers. But if you voted for Reagan, Mulroney, or\nThatcher and you don’t regret it, this cookbook isn’t for you.\n\n\nVegetarian or vegan. Because the two of us writing this cook-\nbook are veg, and we can’t test recipes we won’t eat. Besides, the\nworld is falling apart and the last thing you need is food poisoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe checked and\nPiers Morgan’s\ntears count as\nvegan.\n\n\n\nAt the end of this book, we have listed our personal top picks for Core\nIngredients to Keep in Your Kitchen. These are things that you can stock up\non when you’re in decent enough shape to go grocery shopping. It’s not\nan exhaustive list—it’s just our ideas for what we keep around.\n\n\nWe also list Shopping Lists to go with Weekly Menus. Making decisions is\nhard. We thought you might like it if we made some for you.\n\n\nDespite our deep and abiding love for food, our background is in fiction.\nRachel’s published Cascade ( The Sleep of Reason Book 1 ), Zilla’s got Query\npublished, and Marten’s written a queer steampunk novel you’re go-\ning to adore. There are a lot more great novels, novellas, short stories,\nand games by other members of the Night Beats community, and we all\nshamelessly love pop culture. We couldn’t resist writing jokes in the\nmargins of this cookbook. If you don’t find them funny or haven’t read\nthe books, the recipes will work anyway.\n\n\nThis book will tell you that you should eat, because eating is good, and\nyou are good. There are very few other “shoulds” in this book. If you\navoid carbs when you’re in the Big Sad, you should probably avoid cook-\ning Pasta, Popcorn, and Rice All Together on Toast.* If, like us,\nthe Big Sad means you shove as many carbs as physically\npossible into your mouth hole, then you’re eating, and eat-\ning is, as we said earlier, good. This cookbook is a supportive\nfriend, but you’re the one living your life.\n\n\nIn a just society, everyone would be fed. That is, in our opin-\nion, the bare minimum required to call yourself a civiliza-\ntion, so Tories, please take notes. Depending on where you\nlive, you might be able to access some government sup-\nport, from SNAP to Universal Credit. Beyond this, there\nare mutual aid organizations, like Food Not Bombs,\nthe Hare Krishnas, Sikh temples, and community\ngardens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless they’re the fictional\nwerewolf and vampire\ncops from Night Beats\ninvestigating the strength\nof their feelings, in which\ncase we hope they get as\ninvolved as possible.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/03-introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/04-ramen-variations-part-1/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/04-ramen-variations-part-1/","title":"Ramen Variations Part 1:"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/05-classic-ramen/":{"body":"Sometimes called instant noodles.\nRamen is our ride-or-die. It got us through undergrad, working for poverty\nwages, and too many depressive episodes to count. It’s cheap, versatile, and\ntakes 5–10 minutes to prepare. You can even eat it dry after smashing it up a\nbit, with the powder sprinkled on top, if cooking seems like it’s going to take\ntoo many spoons.\nNot all ramen is created equal. There are off-brand Mr. Noodles that you can\nbuy three for a dollar, but this is an act of desperation. Consider whether, in\nfact, you are that depressed and/or broke. If\nyou can manage it, Nongshim is substantially\npricier but is objectively the best ramen.\nThere are a range of possibilities in between.\nWe recommend swapping up your ingredients\nso you don’t get bored of them.\nCore Ingredients\n\n\nPack of ramen, a.k.a. instant noodles\n\n\nBoiling water\n\n\nPreparation I: Stove\n\nDump the ingredients in a pot as the water is boiling, then mix it up.\n\nPreparation II: Kettle\n\n\nBoil the water in the kettle, add the boiling water, noodles, and flavour\npackage to a bowl, and mix it up.\n\n\nNote that the water will be hot enough to cook the noodles but might not\ndefrost any frozen veg that you add. This is why you have a microwave.\n\n\n\n\nAlso note that any measurements on the side of the package are a sug-\ngestion, not a rule.\n\nPreparation III: Microwave\n\n\nCombine water and ramen in bowl.\n\n\nMicrowave for 1 min. See if it’s cooked.\n\n\nIf not, microwave another minute.\n\n\nRepeat until cooked.\n\n\nBottom-Tier Ingredients\nThese are things you can add that are probably somewhere in your home right now.\n\n\nWilty vegetables. If it’s looking sad in the fridge, it will probably taste\nokay once hot water is added.\n\n\nSoy sauce in packets from your last takeout.\n\n\nHot sauce in packets from your last takeout.\n\n\nWhatever spices you sweep up from the bottom of your cupboard.\n\n\nYou can rawdog it from the package if there’s nothing else.\n\n\nMid-Tier Ingredients\nIf you add these, it’ll taste good, and you likely have at least one.\n\n\nEgg*\n\n\nThe good kind of soy sauce\n\n\n\nA note on the humble egg. There are endless ways to add egg to ramen. Hard-boiled,\nscrambled, or fried—they’re all delicious. Look for these recipes in The Humble Egg.\n\nThere is one egg variation which you can only do with soup, so we’re listing it here.\nCrack the egg into the hot soup, stir it in, and you’ve got a fair approximation of egg-\ndrop soup. If the water isn’t hot enough to cook the egg in the soup, microwave for a\nminute, stir, and repeat until it is cooked. If you’ve made the ramen on a pot on the\nstove, then just keep heating until the egg is cooked.\n\n\n\nSriracha\n\n\nFrozen vegetables\n\n\nFresh vegetables\n\n\nGod-Tier Ingredients\nAdding any of these elevates your ramen to next-level shit that tastes\nlike you’re a fancy lady who went to a restaurant instead of a sad sack\nwho is crying in front of your TV. We recommend stocking up in between\ndepressive episodes, especially for things that don’t go bad.\n\n\nGarlic\n\n\nOnion**\n\n\nGinger\n\n\nChilies\n\n\nKimchi\n\n\nSeaweed\n\n\nTofu\n\n\nCanned baby corn\n\n\nSesame oil\n\n\nHash browns. Hash\nbrowns are delicious in\nramen and we don’t know\nwhy. You have to cook\nthem first before you add them:\nsee our recipe for French Fries a.k.a. Hot Chips.\n\n\n**A note on onion preparation. Unless you like raw, crunchy onions, they generally\ntake a little longer to cook than other vegetables, so you should put them in first. The\nsmaller they are, the faster they’ll cook, but like some cruel Faustian bargain, the\nmore you’ll have to work at chopping them. (Unless you buy pre-chopped, of course.)\nThat said, ignore any recipe that tells you to cook until translucent or worse, cook\nuntil brown. That recipe is not for when you have depression, and they will cook just\nfine alongside the rest of the ramen as you go.\n\n\nShiitake mushrooms. These come dried, so you need to rehydrate them.\nPut them in a jar of water, put that in the fridge, come back to it in a day\nor three. Chop up the mushrooms. You probably don’t want to eat the\nstem since it will never get soft, but the cap is delicious. The liquid also\nmakes great stock to add flavour to the ramen soup—use it instead of\nwater.\n\n\nYou can do this dried mushroom trick with dried seaweed too. Mix them\ntogether in the jar.\n\n\nA word to the wise: Different types of ramen vary as to the vegan-ness, and even\nvegetarian-ness, of their ingredients. If this matters to you, it’s a good idea to check\nthe ingredients closely. Nongshim Soon and Vegetable Mr. Noodles are both vegan.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/05-classic-ramen/","title":"Classic Ramen"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/06-ramen-variations-part-ii-instant/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/06-ramen-variations-part-ii-instant/","title":"Ramen Variations Part II: Instant"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/07-noodles-on-a-plate/":{"body":"Core Ingredients\n\n\nPack of ramen, a.k.a. instant noodles*\n\n\nBoiling water\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nMake your instant noodles with boiling water from the kettle, or by boil-\ning them on the stove like pasta.\n\n\nResist!

Also,\nyou can’t cook them with boiling water straight from the kettle. On the plus\nside, they come in shapes, and anyone who says that alphabet noodles are\nonly for children is lying.\nCore Ingredients\n\n\nAny shape pasta\n\n\nAny sauce\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nBring water to a boil in a pot.\n\n\nAdd the pasta to the boiling water.\n\n\nYou can add salt to the water if it makes you feel\nlike a fancy Italian person with their life together.\nWe’re not entirely sure what the salt does.\n\n\nThe package tells you how long some corporate chef thinks that shape\ntakes to cook. We’re not beholden to their capitalist opinion, also we\nforget what time we added the pasta anyway. Taste it and make up your\nown mind. Try not to scald yourself on the water.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can tell if it’s done by taking out a noodle and flinging\nit at the wall. If it sticks, you’re good. Also, flinging pasta at a wall is a\ngood way to get out your frustrations. Remember to pick it off the wall later\nbefore it becomes a permanent fixture.\n\n\nIf you find a stirring spoon at the bottom of your drawer that has a hole\nin it, the purpose of that hole is to measure out a serving of pasta. The\nhole is a lie. You can have as much pasta as you want. You can make left-\novers for later. You can eat them all in one sitting anyway.\n\n\nKeep the water hot. Simmering if possible? Stir occasionally.\n\n\nIf you have a colander, drain it into a colander. If you’re not that posh,\nuse the pot lid or a slotted spoon. It might seem like a good idea to use a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut pasta on a plate or in a bowl. Or back in the original pot to save on\ndishes.\n\n\nAdd the pasta sauce out of the jar to the pasta and stir through in a hope-\nful attempt to warm it.\n\n\nVariations\nWe can’t imagine adding all these variations to the same bowl of pasta at the same\ntime. Maybe we’re just not creative enough.\n\n\nA can of crushed tomatoes is technically sauce. It might not have depth\nand nuance of flavour or a photograph of someone wearing an apron on\nthe front, but that’s why God gave us hot sauce and Italian herb mix.\n\n\nOlive oil makes great pasta sauce. Surprising but true. Particularly good\nwith other stuff, like salt, or Parmesan cheese, or chili flakes.\n\n\nAdd cheese. The really cheap powdered Parmesan will survive the\napocalypse. We have never seen it go bad. If you’ve got cheddar cheese,\nit’ll taste better grated than in chunks you pulled off with your fingers,\nbut the nutritional content is the same. You could put cheese singles on\ninstead if you hate yourself.\n\n\nNutritional yeast does some of the things that cheese does if you’re veg-\nan or lactose intolerant, and it lasts forever. If you’re on medication—\nfor depression, chronic pain, diabetes, or anything else—check to\nsee if your meds are compatible with nutritional yeast\nbefore you eat it.\n\n\nSalsa is basically pasta sauce, use that.\n\n\nTrue facts: Many types of canned soup make\ndelicious pasta sauce. Tomato soup &amp; milk &amp;\ncheddar cheese is highly traditional. So is cream\nof mushroom soup &amp; a wee bit of milk &amp; crushed up potato chips on top.\n\n\nSeeds and nuts. Pumpkin seeds are fully amazing in pasta. So are sun-\nflower seeds, and they’re even cheaper. Pine nuts are traditional in pas-\nta, but they’re way more expensive than sunflower seeds. Honestly any\nnut or seed has potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd raw garlic.\n\n\nAdd olives. Green or black, from a jar or a can—olives are delicious.\n\n\nHummus also makes an excellent pasta sauce.\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a low-carb alternative, you can buy spaghetti squash\nand zucchini cut into noodle spirals in the frozen veggies section.\n\n\nMid-Tier Pasta Types\n\n\nMix cooked pasta with tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and black pepper.\nThe goal is to mix things together—only the pasta needs to be actually\ncooked. You can also add feta cheese if you’re not\nvegan.\n\n\nOn grocery day, buy some tortellini from the fresh\npasta section. Get a nice pesto in a jar instead of the\ncheapest tomato sauce you can find. You can serve\nthis to a guest and they’ll think you put in effort.\nWhich you did.\n\n\nHonestly any fresh pasta is posh and tastes great.\n\n\nPotato gnocchi is a fancy pasta hack. It costs slight-\nly more, and cooks a bit faster, than other types of\ndried pasta. It stores in your pantry as long as you like, and it tastes good\nprepared with the same sauces you’d use for anything else. People who\ndon’t realise these important gnocchi facts will be impressed when you\nserve it to them.\n\n\nGod-Tier Ingredients\nIf you want to add stuff to the sauce, you’re looking at heating it separately\nbefore you add it to the noodles, either on the stove or in the microwave. Is\nit worth it? Only you can decide.\n\n\nAdd wine. Red goes great in tomato sauce. White goes\ngreat if you’re using Campbell’s cream of mushroom\nsoup as a sauce.\n\n\nAdd frozen veg. Surprisingly tasty choice: frozen spin-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding avocado or canned pumpkin to your sauce makes it richer and\ncreamier.\n\n\nAdd fresh veg. You’ll probably have to cut it up. And cook it in the sauce,\nnot just warm it up. I’m not sure this really counts as depression cooking\nanymore.\n\n\nCanned beans, drained and rinsed. Chickpeas are a personal favourite\nhere.\n\n\nPro-tip: If you find the Alphagetti in the can a little bland, you can kick it up a notch\nwith your Sriracha.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/11-pasta-variations/","title":"Pasta Variations"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/12-literal-depression-cooking/":{"body":"Technically, this recipe came to us from WW2 rationing, not Great\nDepression-era cooking, but we like puns.\nCore Ingredients\n\n\nPasta\n\n\nWater\n\n\nCheese\n\n\nKetchup\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nCook pasta and drain it.\n\n\nAdd it back to the saucepan.\n\n\nAdd ketchup until the pasta doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.\n\n\nAdd grated cheese until it is very cheesy.\n\n\nVariations\n\nUse canned tomato soup instead of ketchup.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/12-literal-depression-cooking/","title":"Literal Depression Cooking"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/13-pasta-in-a-rice-cooker/":{"body":"Core Ingredients\n\n\nPasta\n\n\nWater\n\n\nSauce\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nAdd equal parts pasta and water to the rice cooker.

Instant or regular, depending on how you want to cook it.\n\n\nWater\n\n\nPreparation I: Instant Rice\nInstant rice is God’s gift to depressed people who don’t have rice cookers\nor don’t want to clean one afterwards. It comes in different varieties and\ntastes more or less as good as most other rice but takes half as long. It’s also\nimpossible to burn, for those of us with a tendency to forget what we put on\nthe stove.\nDifferent types of instant rice will have different instructions, but the\nmethod is basically the same.\n\n\nBoil water. Let’s assume you do this in a pot on the stove. You will end up\nusing equal parts rice and water, so if you don’t have a measuring cup,\nyou can use a glass or a mug to measure.\n\n\nWhen your water is boiled, put the boiling water and the rice together in\nthe pot. Cover for as long as it says on the box (usually 5 minutes or so).\nFluff up the rice with a fork, or whatever utensil you have available, or if\nyou’re in full goblin mode, a stick you found on the ground.\n\n\nIf you boiled the water in the kettle, there’s no point in getting a pot\ndirty just to combine the boiling water and rice. Put the rice in a bowl\nwith a plate for a lid. You can eat it out of that same bowl for added effi-\nciency.\n\n\nPreparation II: Rice Cooker\nRice cookers are great when you are too tired or depressed to stand over the\nstove. If you have a person in your life who struggles with depression but\nlikes rice, and it’s getting close to their birthday, we seriously suggest a rice\ncooker as a gift. Maybe that person is you, and you buy it for yourself. Rice\ncookers are magical devices that make nice food while you’re back in bed.\nThe fancy rice cookers with lots of buttons are nice, but the cheap ones with\nonly one button do the job plenty well.\n\n\nWash your rice cooker, because you probably skipped the final step of\nthese instructions last time.\n\n\nAdd equal parts white rice and water.\n\n\nYou can add a little extra water if you like it moister.\n\n\nPut on the lid.\n\n\nClick the start button.\n\n\nCome back when it makes the happy “rice is ready!” noise.\n\n\nOr not, rice cookers always have a “keep warm” function so it’s fine if\nyou miss the noise.\n\n\nThe easiest way to clean the rice cooker is to pull out the inner pot, fill it\nwith water, and let it soak. Wash it in the morning. Or right before you\nuse it next.\n\n\nIf you’re not gonna wash the rice cooker, leave it open so it dries out\ninstead of staying moist and getting moldy.\n\n\nPreparation III: Rice on the Stove\n\n\nAdd rice (maybe 1 cup?).\n\n\nAdd twice as much water as rice (maybe 2 cups?).\n\n\nCook on high heat, without stirring, until the water reaches the top of\nthe rice.\n\n\n\n\n\nCover the rice with the lid and turn off the stove.\n\n\nLeave the pot on the stove (with the heat off) for ten minutes or so.\n\n\nCome back and there’s rice!\n\n\nWord to the wise: It’s easier to cook rice if you make at least one cup of\ndried rice. If you try to make less, it’s likely to burn. But the more the\nmerrier—leftover rice is really useful. Just keep it in the fridge between\nmeals.\n\n\nVariations\n\n\nYou can eat it as is. Plain rice can be really comforting when you’re feel-\ning a bit nauseous.\n\n\nYou can add sauce. Literally any sauce. Soy sauce, salad dressing, hum-\nmus, pasta sauce, hot sauce.\n\n\nYou can also add lots of other stuff. We have more rice\nvariations waiting for you in the next few pages.\n\n\nBrown rice exists but we’re not sure why. Wild rice is amazing but\nwe’re scared in case it cooks differently—it might require paying\nattention.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/22-cook-the-rice/","title":"Cook the Rice"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/23-rice-variations-part-ii/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/23-rice-variations-part-ii/","title":"Rice Variations Part II:"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/24-add-stuff-to-the-cooking-water/":{"body":"If you add flavouring to the cooking water, the rice absorbs it as it cooks.\nBoom! Flavoured rice! These can go with either instant or regular rice.\nCore Ingredients\n\nDried rice, instant or regular, which you can cook with flavourings and\nvegetables and stuff.\n\nVariations: Flavouring\nAdd a stock cube or some spices to the water before it cooks. We recommend\nmushroom stock or curry powder. If you’re only making a wee bit of rice,\nyou can add only part of the stock cube, but rice makes great leftovers.\n\n\nThe saddest variation: Add a stock cube to the rice-water mixture and\nstir a bit. It won’t fully dissolve right away, but you can even out the\nflavour by stirring some more once the rice is done cooking.\n\n\nMore effort and less sad variation: Boil water in the kettle, dissolve the\nstock cube in a mug of hot water and add it to the rice. Then add the rest\nof the water as usual.\n\n\nSaffron is popular and adds a really nice colour.\n\n\nVariations: Vegetables\nThis is an ideal place to use frozen or wilty vegetables, since they cook with\nthe rice. For God-Tier, make regular rice on the stove or rice cooker, wait\nuntil it’s partway done, then throw the vegetables on top of the rice to\nsteam. For us mere mortals, add them at the beginning so you don’t forget.\nIf you do this with instant rice, you might need to microwave it at the end if\nthe veggies aren’t fully cooked.\n\n\nAdd any frozen vegetables. Peas are a classic.\n\n\nOr any wilty vegetables from the back of your fridge.\n\n\nOr fresh vegetables, if you’ve got them and are willing to chop.\n\n\nAdd canned beans. Drain and rinse them, of course. Rinsing in the can\ntotally works and saves washing the colander. If you add them now,\nthey will get warm with the rice. If you add them after cooking the rice,\nthey’ll be closer to room temperature. The choice is yours.\n\n\nGod-Tier: Coconut Rice\nIf you’re replacing the water with something—for example coconut milk—\nyou need to make rice in a pot or a rice cooker. Boiling coconut milk in the\nkettle to make instant rice sounds like an idea with negative long-term\nconsequences to the kettle.\n\n\nReplace half the water with coconut milk. Cook as usual.\n\n\nGoes great with some frozen veg thrown in before cooking, and some\nseeds or nuts added after cooking.\n\n\nYou can also cook rice normally, add some of a can of coconut milk, a\nlittle curry powder, and sweet chili sauce for a delicious take on Thai\ncoconut curry!\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/24-add-stuff-to-the-cooking-water/","title":"Add Stuff to the Cooking Water"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/25-rice-variations-part-iii/":{"body":"","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/25-rice-variations-part-iii/","title":"Rice Variations Part III:"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/26-add-stuff-to-the-cooked-rice/":{"body":"These can be made with fresh rice, or leftover rice you heat up in the\nmicrowave.\nCore Ingredients\n\nRice (see Rice Variations Part I &amp; Part II for cooking instructions and fla-\nvouring ideas)\n\nVariations: Flavouring\nIt’s hard to know what to say here.

But some days it’s easier to talk about nutrition than to be\nthe change, and picking your battles is a life skill for an activist.\nIf you don’t peel the potatoes—and why would you—make sure you wash off\nany dirt.

Plum sauce is\na classic. They also pair well with Fried Rice.\n\nA UK-based recipe tester informed us that the brand Tiger Tiger: Tsingtao Spring\nRolls are both cheap and delicious.

There are dozens of recipes, and we couldn’t agree on the\nbest one, so we’re including a bunch of them. Pick whichever you can make\nwith the ingredients you’ve already got in the kitchen.\nRemember that time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so, and you can eat pancakes for\nany meal.\nCore Ingredients\n\n\nCooking oil or butter or margarine\n\n\nFlour\n\n\nWater\n\n\nEggs or baking powder or yeast &amp; sugar (depends on the recipe)\n\n\nPreparation I: Irish-Style Pancake Batter\nThese make a flatter pancake than American-style\nfluffy pancakes. A more refined, European pancake.\nSomething heading in the direction of a crepe, but not\nclosing the distance.\nWe include weights, since that’s how the recipe was contributed, but if you\ndon’t have a scale you could try 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water. If you want\nit thinner, add more water. If you want it thicker, add more flour. Write the\nquantities you like best in the margins. Personalize this book.\n\nMix together:\n\nFlour (100 g)\nWater (300 g a.k.a. 300 mL)\n1 raw egg\nuntil they turn into pancake batter.\n\nPreparation II: “Two of Everything” Fluffy Pancakes\n\nMix together:\n\nFlour (2 cups)\nWater (2 cups)\nBaking powder (2 teaspoons)\n2 raw eggs\nuntil they turn into pancake batter.\n\nLet it sit for a few minutes for the baking powder to do its thing. Make\nyourself a cup of coffee.\n\nPreparation III: “Even Fluffier” Fluffy Pancakes (Can be Veganized)\n\nMix together:\n\nFlour (2 cups)\nWater (1.5 cups)\nBaking powder (3 teaspoons)\n2 raw eggs (optional)\nDollop of vegetable oil\nuntil they turn into pancake batter.\n\n\nLet it sit for a few minutes for the baking powder to do its thing. Make\nyourself a cup of tea.\n\n\nYou might need to play around with the amount of liquid—add a bit\nmore if it’s too thick. You can always add more flour if it ends up too\nliquidy. Repeat this process forever to end up with infinite pancake batter.\n\n\nPreparation IV: Vegan Pancakes with Yeast\nThese are a bit more complicated, but we didn’t want to leave vegans out of the\npancake adventures. The previous recipe can be veganized deliciously, but this one\ndoesn’t even call for eggs.\n\nMix together:\n\nDry instant yeast (2 teaspoons)\nSugar (2 teaspoons)\nRoom temperature water* (2 cups)\n\n\n\n\nAdd flour (2 cups).\n\n\nMix until it turns into pancake batter.\n\n\nPreparation V: Pancake Mix from a Box\nIf you’re dealing with something like depression, pre-mixed ingredients can be a\ngift. They’re more expensive than the individual ingredients. Our society makes it\nfinancially costly to be physically or mentally unwell because it doesn’t consider\nhuman life to be intrinsically valuable. We have opinions on our society.\nIf you do buy boxed mix, we highly recommend getting the version where\nall you add is water and butter. If you’re adding eggs and milk, you might be\npaying four times as much for flour in a box. Don’t waste your money on the\nPancake Industrial Complex.\n\nMix together:\n\nWhatever the box suggests until it turns into pancake batter.\nPreparation: Do This No Matter What\n\n\nTurn on medium heat and let the pan warm up a bit. Or not, if you’re\nhungry and rushing.\n\n\nAdd cooking oil to the frying pan.\n\n\nAdd a scoop of batter to the hot frying pan. Some people use a ladle. We\nuse the cup measure we got dirty when measuring the flour. Save your-\nself washing the ladle.\n\n\nYou wanna cook the pancake some of the way through so it’s got struc-\ntural integrity, then flip it and cook the bottom. How do you know when\nit’s time to flip? Crepe-style enthusiasts tell us to swirl the pancake bat-\nter around the pan, flip, and serve. Fluffy-pancake connoisseurs speak of\nwaiting for bubbles to appear in the pancake, then flipping and waiting a\nminute or two. Personally, we adopt a “trial and error” approach.**\n\n\n** For whatever reason, the first couple of pancakes never turn out as well as the\nlater ones. To paraphrase a famous chef, “The pan needs to get to know the pancakes,\nand the pancakes need to get to know the pan.”\n&lt;\nVariations: Batter\nEnhance your pancake experience by adding these.\n\n\nIf you substitute milk or plant milk for the water, you’ll get a richer\npancake. This only works if you have milk in the house, which sounds\nunlikely.\n\n\nAdd frozen fruit to the pancake batter. Don’t defrost it first.\n\n\nAdd fresh fruit to the pancake batter. If you add fresh blueberries to the\npancake batter, they will turn into weapons-grade pockets of molten juice. You\nhave been warned.\n\n\nAdd a pinch of salt to the batter.\n\n\nAdd 3 tablespoons of sugar to the batter.\n\n\nAdd a dollop of vanilla. Or two.\n\n\nVariations: Toppings\n\n\nPeasant: lemon and sugar\n\n\nLayperson: nutella\n\n\nGymfreak: peanut butter and strawberry jam\n\n\nTennis player: sliced strawberries and cream\n\n\nCanadian: maple syrup\n\n\nBritish: golden syrup\n\n\nSpiced: cinnamon and sugar\n\n\nLoaded: yogurt, nuts and defrosted frozen fruit\n\n\nDutch-style: cheese and apple slices\n\n\nSavoury: hummus, fried mushrooms, and spinach fried with cumin.

Cut it with scissors.\nZucchini and mushroom are both very tasty if you can be bothered to\nslice them thin.\n\n\nVary your dipping sauce. For example, instead of soy sauce on a plate,\nyou could put Sriracha on a plate. Or both!

That’s how you make eggs “over hard.” That is a valid cook-\ning option.\n\n\nIf you stir the eggs a bunch, that’s “scrambled eggs.”\n\n\nIf you stir the eggs in a bowl, then pour them in the pan and don’t touch\nthem again until they’re cooked through, that’s an “omelette.”\n\n\n* If you don’t peel the leftover eggs immediately (and why would you?), make sure\nyou’ve got a method to tell cooked and raw eggs apart in the fridge.

Your list is probably different! But we thought you\nmight be inspired by seeing our faves.\n\n\nFrozen vegetables. Frozen veg are vastly underrated. They’ve got the\nsame nutritional content as fresh, they’re pre-chopped, and they don’t\ngo bad in the fridge when you neglect them for weeks. You do pay more\nfor quality. But there’s nothing wrong with store-brand mixes, and\nthey’re cheaper than fresh too. We recommend keeping in the freezer\nthree different kinds— spinach , corn , and a vegetable mix. But play\naround with different types. This is a choice with no bad options.\n\n\nRamen. Or, if you’re Irish, instant noodles.\n\n\nSpices. Spices exist for a reason, and that’s to make sad food taste better\nand bad food last longer. We highly recommend curry powder , which is\nlots of spices mixed together to save you time. Italian seasoning is also\na great mix. And seasoning salt —then you don’t even need to add salt.\nPepper is a classic. Despite what the label says, most spices don’t go off. If you\ncan separate them and they smell good, they are probably fine to use.\n\n\nGarlic. We are listing this separately from other\nspices because it’s the best one. It comes in many\ndifferent forms, from powdered (lasts forever), to\ntube (easy and mess free), to bottled minced, to fro-\nzen (also lasts forever), to fresh (most flavourful but\nyou have to chop or press it). You can buy peeled\ngarlic and save yourself some time. It also keeps\nvampires away, though only the bloodsucking kind and not the emotion-\nal kind.\n\n\nOnions. You can also get pre-chopped\nonions either fresh or frozen. It’s more\nmoney, but less cutting and less crying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalt. Salt exists to make food less bland. Salt is a gift you give yourself.\n\n\nSoy sauce. Salt with flavour.\n\n\nCouscous. Or instant rice. Or instant oatmeal. Maybe all of these. You\nneed a carb you can cook with nothing more complicated than a kettle,\na bowl, and a spoon. Bowl and spoon optional. Any watertight container and\nstirring implement will do. Empty yogurt tub and plastic knife, your moment has\narrived.\n\n\nSome sort of cooking oil or spray. We recommend the cheapest kind\nyou can find. A basic olive oil makes a nice sauce, but if you’re only\nbuying one type of oil, canola oil is often cheapest and it fries things very\nwell. As does a nice generic “vegetable oil.” Butter or margarine also\nwork here.\n\n\nNut, seeds, &amp; dried fruit. Nuts and seeds are tiny stores of healthy oils\nand protein. Plus they taste great. And they can go in basically anything,\nor you can eat them on their own, on your couch, as you read Cascade. A\nnut mix will have lots of them together, or buy your favourites separate-\nly. Peanut , sunflower seeds , and raisins are usually the cheapest.\n\n\nPasta sauce. Whatever kind you like best. Salsa makes a remarkably\ngood pasta sauce. Lots of types of canned soup also make good pasta\nsauces. Bonus, canned soup is also great for making soup!\n\n\nPasta. Whatever shape you like best.\n\n\nCheddar cheese. Yes it goes bad, eventually. No, it’s not vegan. We’re\nbad at following rules, even ones we make ourselves.\n\n\nBread and bread-like substances. Did you know you can freeze\nbread? The texture can be wrong afterwards but, if so, you\ncan fix it by toasting it. Defrost it by toasting it twice. Or\ndefrost it on the counter and toast it once. We recommend\nbread , and/or bagels.\n\n\nSomething to spread on bread. And to use with other things!\nConsider: margarine , butter , mayonnaise , sandwich spread ,\njam , hummus. Or others! The world is yours. At least the spreads aisle is\nyours.\n\n\nPeanut butter. The spread is so useful we listed it separately. We per-\nsonally prefer the “peanuts only, crunchy” type. But unless you have a\nnut allergy, there are no bad options among the nut butters.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanned beans. Dried beans are cheaper than canned, but they take a lot\nmore prep. Like, hours more. Canned beans are already plenty cheap. A\nbean medley will let you make bean salad, lentils make great soup, and\nchickpeas will enhance basically any dish. And other types are great too.\nIf you’re prone to gas, the bean liquid can make you bloated, which feels like bad\nperiod cramps. Pour the liquid away and rinse the beans in the can. Rinsing them\nin a colander is more effective, but it makes another dish dirty. Conversely, if this\nisn’t a problem for you, you can keep the liquid for aquafaba, which is a great\nvegan egg substitute.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/89-core-ingredients-to-keep-in-your-kitchen/","title":"Core Ingredients to Keep in Your Kitchen"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/90-zilla-s-shopping-list-weekly-menu/":{"body":"Shopping list\n\n\nPeanut butter\n\n\nJam\n\n\nInstant oatmeal\n\n\nCereal\n\n\nNut &amp; raisin mix\n\n\nCocoa powder\n\n\nCorn starch\n\n\nSugar\n\n\nCinnamon powder\n\n\nCurry powder\n\n\nBread (store in the freezer)\n\n\nTortilla wraps\n\n\nPlant milk\n\n\nFrozen mixed vegetables\n\n\nFrozen vegetarian spring rolls\n\n\nRice\n\n\nCouscous\n\n\nUdon noodles\n\n\nRamen\n\n\nOil\n\n\nSoy sauce\n\n\nSesame oil\n\n\nSalsa\n\n\nCanned minestrone soup (two cans)\n\n\n\n\n\nCanned lentils\n\n\nCanned black beans\n\n\nSweet potato\n\n\nPlantains\n\n\nWeekly Menu\nMonday\nBreakfast: Toast with peanut butter and jam.\nLunch: Ramen with no sides made using the work kettle.\nDinner: Lentils in a pot with curry powder, served over couscous.

We want to thank the following people\nwho suggested recipes, beta read and tested meals, and supported us during\nthe book-making process.\nSpecial thank you to Rohan O’Duill, who assisted us as both an author and\na professional chef, despite his abject horror at most of the recipes in this\nbook. This isn’t the kind of food he cooks in his kitchen, but he still managed\nto make the recipes both simpler and tastier. We couldn’t have written this\nbook without him.\nTo Nicole Northwood, fixer of words, contributor of recipes, marketing\nexpert, and mentor in the intimidating world of publishing. The fact that this\nbook is in your hands shows what a kick-ass teacher she is.\nTo our editors. Victoria Rose (Flickering Words) and Lindsay Hobbs (Topaz\nLiterary) saw our project and asked us if we needed editors—simply because\nthey believed in what we were trying to create. The best part of working\nwith Victoria was having an editor with high-level cooking expertise. She\nknew what we were trying to express, so she was able to edit for clarity of\ncooking instructions, as well as for language errors. Lindsay formatted all\nour headings, subheadings, and footnotes so they had consistent styles,\nturning our ramblings into a structured book. Both were able to see our\nerrors when repetition meant the words on the page no longer possessed\nmeaning to our very tired eyes. We are so immensely grateful, both for the\ninvaluable edits but also the vote of confidence in our work from the offer\nitself.\nTo Rysz Merey, excellent friend and supremely dedicated formatter. We\nthought turning this cookbook into an epub was the Kobayashi Maru\nscenario of layout, but you managed to cut through the Gordian Knot, to mix\nour metaphors like we’d mix a pot of soup.\nTo our tireless team of proofreaders: Anna Borisovskaya, Emma Berglund,\nNicole Northwood, and Rysz Merey. Your eyes were so helpful, especially\nafter we pulled all nighters and couldn’t read our own words anymore.\nTo the many people who contributed recipes, and to our tireless beta testing\nteam, who turned this from a series of jokes into workable instructions.
