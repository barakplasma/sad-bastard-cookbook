title = "Apocalypse Ramen"
+++

This is basically like regular ramen soup but with three critical differences:

- It is intensely chaotic, which is to say that you can pretty much toss any-
thing into it and say you did it on purpose.

- It’s slightly healthier, if your depression has lifted enough that you want
to eat something other than delicious, delicious chemicals.

- It involves a mason jar, so you can feel like you’re riding out the end of
days in true hipster style.

**Core Ingredients & Supplies**
- Mason jar or other heatproof receptacle

- Boiling water

- The only requirement here is rice noodles. Why? Because they cook fast.

**Preparation**
- Put all ingredients in the jar.

- Boil some water.

- Pour into jar to cover ingredients.

- Shake it up a bit (not right away, otherwise you’ll burn your hands and
get more depressed).

- Let it sit for a few minutes.

- Enjoy???



**Variations**
- Remember those takeout packets of hot sauce and soy sauce? This is a
good time to use them.

- Frozen or fresh vegetables. Wilted is absolutely fine here. _International
readers may call them “wilty” vegetables. Reader, you are now bilingual._

- Any kind of spices. We particularly suggest garlic or ginger powder, but
seriously, anything will work.

- If you have tofu or some other protein to use, go for it.
