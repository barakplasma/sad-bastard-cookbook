## Apple Slices Yes }

**Core Ingredients**
< Apples

**Preparation**
< Quarters is the fewest number of cuts you can make and still easily re-
move the core.

< You can cut it into more pieces if you want to.

< If you’re only gonna cut the apple into halves, you might as well just eat
the whole apple as is.

< If you’re lucky enough to have an apple corer/slicer device, you basically
won the apple-eating lottery.

**Variations**
< Spread with peanut butter in the ratio most
appealing to you and consume. Or use a
spoon or melon baller to scoop the seeds out
and stuff the peanut butter in where they
were—if you do this, you can get away with
only cutting the apple into halves.

< Cheese has an added slicing step, unless you
buy the pre-sliced packs, which some people
do.

< Either of those could also be combined with
crackers.

< Sprinkle cinnamon on top.

< Other sliceable fruits, such as pears or peach-
es, can be enjoyed in similar manners.

By popular demand, we are including apple
slices as its own recipe instead of as a
recipe variation. The people have spoken.

This cooking instruction is
surprisingly controversial.
Some people say that
spreading the peanut
butter on each slice is a
waste of effort, when
you could put a dollop of
peanut butter on a plate
and dip the slices in. Others
respond that dipping in solid
peanut butter works about
as well as dipping apple slices
in solid cement. This is
going to be a bigger fight
than what colour that
one dress was, or whether
capitalism has any role in a
just society.
