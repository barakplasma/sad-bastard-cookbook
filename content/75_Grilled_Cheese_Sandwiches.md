## Grilled Cheese Sandwiches

**Core Ingredients**
< Bread

< Cheese

< Butter or margarine or oil if you’re making
this in a frying pan

**Preparation: Do This No Matter What**
< Put sliced cheese between two sides of bread.

**Preparation I: Microwave**
< Put on a plate and microwave until the cheese is melty.

**Preparation II: Oven**
< Spread butter or margarine on both sides of the bread.

< Put on a baking tray and bake in the oven at 400°F or 200°C until the
cheese is melty. This should take only 5 minutes or so.

< Flip the sandwich halfway through cooking.

**Preparation III: Frying Pan**
< Put a wee bit of oil or margarine or butter in the pan and put the stove
on low or medium heat.

< Cook the sandwich until one side of the bread is crispy, then flip it and
cook the other side. You can add more margarine when you flip it so
both sides get some. Try to pay some attention so that you flip it before
the bread turns to charcoal.

< If you put a lid or large plate on the pan, the cheese will get extra melty.

**Preparation IV: Grilled-Cheese Machine**
Grilled-cheese machines exist (for under $20). They don’t foolproof it, but

```
If you use American cheese
singles, you don’t need to
slice the cheese yourself.
But on the downside, then
you need to eat American
cheese singles.

```
FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE
```
they make sealed grilled cheese as long as a) you line up the cheese and
bread perfectly and b) you unplug them when the light goes off. If either of
these points are not observed, cheese bubbles out and you have to clean the
grilled-cheese maker. Or you could just throw it out and buy another one,
they’re so cheap and the frustration is so great from some cheese messes.

< Put a slice of white squishy soft crusted bread on bottom of machine in
appropriate slots.

< Put slices of cheese precisely on top of bread so none falls over the edges
of the bread. _If any does, tear it off like a wild animal and eat it as a prize, or
add it on top of the cheese slice for an extra cheese pocket._

< Line up the other slice of fluffy, squishy, soft crusted bread on top of the
cheese.

< Close the machine and plug in.

< When the light goes green and you hear the ding, unplug immediately
and _carefully_ remove your sandwiches

**Variations**
< Slice diagonally.

< Slice vertically.

< Slice horizontally you absolute Lord of Chaos.

< Pair with ketchup.

< Add fried onions inside the sandwich.

< Add jam inside the sandwich.

< Add avocado inside the sandwich.

< Add thinly sliced apple inside the sandwich.

< Add spices like everything-bagel seasoning or dried garlic to the sand-
wich.

< If you’re making it in a frying pan, spread a little bit of mayo on both
outsides of the sandwich. Sounds gross, but it’s incredible.

< Pairing with tomato soup is a classic!

< Don’t include the top slice of bread—make an open-faced melted cheese
sandwich instead. Not recommended in a grilled-cheese machine.
