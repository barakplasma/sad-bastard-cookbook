**Core Ingredients**
- Eggs

- Bread

**Preparation I: Eggs on Toast**
- Toast bread

- Cook _The Humble Egg_ —fried, scrambled, or hard-boiled. If it’s hard-boiled,
you can slice it or mash it with a fork.

- Goes well with mayonnaise, butter, margarine, or ketchup.

**Preparation II: Eggs in a Hole**
- Cut out a hole in the middle of the bread. _Snack on the cut-out bread while
doing the rest of the steps._

- Put a bit of oil or butter in a frying pan on medium heat. Put the bread in
the frying pan.

- Crack an egg into the hole. Cook it until the clear liquid starts going
white where it touches the pan.

- Flip the toast so the egg cooks on both sides. If you flip
it too soon and some of the whites aren’t cooked, you
can always flip it back.

- Congratulations! You have an egg in a toast hole.

- Optional: add salt and pepper.

**Preparation III: French Toast, or, Eggy Bread**
- Crack egg into a shallow bowl _(or a deep bowl if the shallow ones are all dirty)_.
Break the yolk with a fork and mix it around a bit.

- Add a splash of milk if you’re feeling fancy. Mix that in with the fork.

- Dip bread into the egg mixture. Flip so both sides get eggy.

- Place in a frying pan with a little butter or margarine or oil. Fry on medi-
um or low just until golden on both sides.

- Can be served with lots of toppings, including: jam, maple syrup, golden
syrup, honey, dried fruit, defrosted frozen fruit, fresh fruit, nuts, cin-
namon, and/or yogurt. Anything that tasted good on _Pancakes_ will taste
good on French toast.
