## The Fastest Nachos }

**Core Ingredients**
You can make this vegan by using salsa instead of cheese as your core
ingredient

< Tortilla chips, a.k.a. nacho chips

< Cheese or salsa (or both)

**Preparation**
< Spread some tortilla chips on a plate.

< Dump shredded cheese on the tortilla chips. If you didn’t buy pre-shred-
ded cheese, tear off chunks of cheddar like a Palaeolithic human tearing
rocks off a mountain.

< Alternatively, pour salsa on the chips.

< Stick that plate of chips in the microwave like the high-class delicacy it
is.

< After 30 seconds or a minute, take them out of the microwave and eat
them.

**God-Tier**
Same thing but in the oven instead of in the microwave.

**Variations: Add on Top Before Cooking**
< Corn, canned or frozen. If you’re using canned, drain them. Rinse them
too, if you’re feeling fancy. If you’re using frozen, defrost them in the
microwave.

< Sliced olives

< Canned jalapeno slices

< Other canned chilis, if you’re the kind of wild rebel who doesn’t think
jalapenos are hot enough.

< Cut up raw onion, if you’re into that.

wave.
