**Core ingredients**
< Any kind of cereal

**Preparation**
< Eat, dry, out of the box.

**Mid-Tier**
< Pour into a bowl, add plant milk. Plant milk comes in cartons, which
means it doesn’t go bad in your pantry like weak-ass cow milk.

< Or add yogurt instead.

< Or yogurt and jam!

< Maybe some fruit on top? Fresh or frozen and defrosted in the micro-
wave?

< Or nuts, dried fruits (like raisins, cranberries, and blueberries), and seeds
(like sunflower seeds).

< If you use a can of fruit and pour in the juice, you don’t need milk or
yogurt.

**Eddy-No-Tier**
< Pour into a bowl, and add cream-based liquor of your choice.
