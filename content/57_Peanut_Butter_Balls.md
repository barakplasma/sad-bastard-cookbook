## Peanut Butter Balls }

Make semi-portable, extra-high protein snacks! This requires arm strength
or cleaning a blender or a food processor. And it requires more preparation
than literally eating out of the jar. But you can make it on a good day and
freeze it so that you have food for bad days.

**Core Ingredients**
< An amount of nut butter (depending on how many balls you want).

< A slightly lesser amount of honey, maple syrup, date syrup or other syr-
up-y thing, or an equivalent amount of brown sugar.

< Some bit of protein powder or almond flour or what-have-you.

**Preparation**
< Stir by hand or with a food processor or a blender.

< Shape into a ball.

< Optional: freeze so they stay in ball shape.

< Consume.

**Variations**
< Use canned chickpeas instead of protein powder, but you’ll need me-
chanical assistance to stir this, and who wants to wash
the food processor?

< Add oats for superior structural integrity.

< Add chocolate powder.

< Add chocolate chips.
