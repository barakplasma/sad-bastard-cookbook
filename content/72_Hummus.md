## Hummus }

Hummus is awesome because it tastes good, it’s highly portable, and it’s even
healthy and full of protein.

**Core Ingredients**
< Hummus from the store.

< Carrots. Baby carrots or adult carrots: the choice is yours.

**Preparation**
Some people say you need to peel adult carrots. They are liars. Washing
them is good—dirt has a terrible texture.

< Dip carrots into hummus.

< Eat.

**Variations**
< If you are feeling more ambitious, there are other vegetables to dip into
the hummus. Peppers. Celery, if you must.

< Add a dash of olive oil and a spice like thyme or chili to the top of your
hummus to be a Fancy Sad Bastard.

< Dip cheese into hummus.

< Dip tortilla chips or pita chips.

< Spread hummus on bread or toast.

< Use hummus as a sauce over pasta
or rice.

< Hummus is also great eaten off a
spoon standing in front of the fridge.

You can buy it discounted from the store

Unless Ian from Cascade bought the last
