## Popcorn }

**Core Ingredients**
< Popcorn

**Preparation I: Microwave**
< Microwave the bag of popcorn for 15 seconds less than it says to on the
bag, or it’ll burn.

**Preparation II: Air Popper**
< Start by owning an air popper.

< Add popcorn kernels and turn on.

< You can eat the plain popcorn that comes out.

**Variations**
< You can melt some butter or margarine in the microwave and put that
on top of plain popcorn.

< You can use the spray oil you bought for cooking as a way to add oil.

< Oil or butter or margarine will make other stuff stick, so now you can
add salt.

< You can add spices like smoked paprika.

< Or buy cheese powder from Bulk Barn and add that.

This depends on your
microwave. Rachel’s requires
10 seconds more.
