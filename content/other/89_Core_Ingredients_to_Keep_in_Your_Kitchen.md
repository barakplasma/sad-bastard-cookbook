title = "Core Ingredients to Keep in Your Kitchen"
+++

These are our top picks for what ingredients we keep in our kitchens at all
times so we don’t starve. Your list is probably different! But we thought you
might be inspired by seeing our faves.

- **Frozen vegetables**. Frozen veg are vastly underrated. They’ve got the
same nutritional content as fresh, they’re pre-chopped, and they don’t
go bad in the fridge when you neglect them for weeks. You do pay more
for quality. But there’s nothing wrong with store-brand mixes, and
they’re cheaper than fresh too. We recommend keeping in the freezer
three different kinds— **spinach** , **corn** , and a **vegetable mix**. But play
around with different types. This is a choice with no bad options.

- **Ramen**. Or, if you’re Irish, **instant noodles**.

- **Spices.** Spices exist for a reason, and that’s to make sad food taste better
and bad food last longer. We highly recommend **curry powder** , which is
lots of spices mixed together to save you time. **Italian seasoning** is also
a great mix. And **seasoning salt** —then you don’t even need to add salt.
**Pepper** is a classic. _Despite what the label says, most spices don’t go off. If you
can separate them and they smell good, they are probably fine to use._

- **Garlic.** We are listing this separately from other
spices because it’s the best one. It comes in many
different forms, from powdered (lasts forever), to
tube (easy and mess free), to bottled minced, to fro-
zen (also lasts forever), to fresh (most flavourful but
you have to chop or press it). You can buy peeled
garlic and save yourself some time. It also keeps
vampires away, though only the bloodsucking kind and not the emotion-
al kind.

- **Onions**. You can also get pre-chopped
onions either fresh or frozen. It’s more
money, but less cutting and less crying.

- **Salt**. Salt exists to make food less bland. Salt is a gift you give yourself.

- **Soy sauce**. Salt with flavour.

- **Couscous**. Or **instant rice**. Or **instant oatmeal**. Maybe all of these. You
need a carb you can cook with nothing more complicated than a kettle,
a bowl, and a spoon. _Bowl and spoon optional. Any watertight container and
stirring implement will do. Empty yogurt tub and plastic knife, your moment has
arrived._

- **Some sort of cooking oil or spray.** We recommend the cheapest kind
you can find. A basic olive oil makes a nice sauce, but if you’re only
buying one type of oil, canola oil is often cheapest and it fries things very
well. As does a nice generic “vegetable oil.” Butter or margarine also
work here.

- **Nut, seeds, & dried fruit**. Nuts and seeds are tiny stores of healthy oils
and protein. Plus they taste great. And they can go in basically anything,
or you can eat them on their own, on your couch, as you read _Cascade_. A
**nut mix** will have lots of them together, or buy your favourites separate-
ly. **Peanut** , **sunflower seeds** , and **raisins** are usually the cheapest.

- **Pasta sauce**. Whatever kind you like best. **Salsa** makes a remarkably
good pasta sauce. Lots of types of **canned soup** also make good pasta
sauces. Bonus, canned soup is also great for making soup!

- **Pasta**. Whatever shape you like best.

- **Cheddar cheese.** Yes it goes bad, eventually. No, it’s not vegan. We’re
bad at following rules, even ones we make ourselves.

- **Bread and bread-like substances**. Did you know you can freeze
bread? The texture can be wrong afterwards but, if so, you
can fix it by toasting it. Defrost it by toasting it twice. Or
defrost it on the counter and toast it once. We recommend
**bread** , and/or **bagels**.

- **Something to spread on bread**. And to use with other things!
Consider: **margarine** , **butter** , **mayonnaise** , **sandwich spread** ,
**jam** , **hummus**. Or others! The world is yours. At least the spreads aisle is
yours.

- **Peanut butter**. The spread is so useful we listed it separately. We per-
sonally prefer the “peanuts only, crunchy” type. But unless you have a
nut allergy, there are no bad options among the nut butters.

FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE

- **Canned beans**. Dried beans are cheaper than canned, but they take a lot
more prep. Like, hours more. Canned beans are already plenty cheap. A
**bean medley** will let you make bean salad, **lentils** make great soup, and
**chickpeas** will enhance basically any dish. And other types are great too.
_If you’re prone to gas, the bean liquid can make you bloated, which feels like bad
period cramps. Pour the liquid away and rinse the beans in the can. Rinsing them
in a colander is more effective, but it makes another dish dirty. Conversely, if this
isn’t a problem for you, you can keep the liquid for aquafaba, which is a great
vegan egg substitute._
