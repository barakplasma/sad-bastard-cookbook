## Classic Ramen }

_Sometimes called instant noodles._

Ramen is our ride-or-die. It got us through undergrad, working for poverty
wages, and too many depressive episodes to count. It’s cheap, versatile, and
takes 5–10 minutes to prepare. You can even eat it dry after smashing it up a
bit, with the powder sprinkled on top, if cooking seems like it’s going to take
too many spoons.

Not all ramen is created equal. There are off-brand Mr. Noodles that you can
buy three for a dollar, but this is an act of desperation. Consider whether, in
fact, you are _that_ depressed and/or broke. If
you can manage it, Nongshim is substantially
pricier but is objectively the best ramen.
There are a range of possibilities in between.

We recommend swapping up your ingredients
so you don’t get bored of them.

**Core Ingredients**
< Pack of ramen, a.k.a. instant noodles

< Boiling water

**Preparation I: Stove**
< Dump the ingredients in a pot as the water is boiling, then mix it up.

**Preparation II: Kettle**
< Boil the water in the kettle, add the boiling water, noodles, and flavour
package to a bowl, and mix it up.

< Note that the water will be hot enough to cook the noodles but might not
defrost any frozen veg that you add. This is why you have a microwave.

```
Well, it is subjectively the best
ramen, since others also exist.
But don’t worry, you have a
lifetime to select your own
favourite.

THE SAD BASTARD COOKBOOK

< Also note that any measurements on the side of the package are a sug-
gestion, not a rule.

**Preparation III: Microwave**
< Combine water and ramen in bowl.

< Microwave for 1 min. See if it’s cooked.

< If not, microwave another minute.

< Repeat until cooked.

**Bottom-Tier Ingredients**
These are things you can add that are probably somewhere in your home right now.

< Wilty vegetables. If it’s looking sad in the fridge, it will probably taste
okay once hot water is added.

< Soy sauce in packets from your last takeout.

< Hot sauce in packets from your last takeout.

< Whatever spices you sweep up from the bottom of your cupboard.

< You can rawdog it from the package if there’s nothing else.

**Mid-Tier Ingredients**
If you add these, it’ll taste good, and you likely have at least one.

< Egg*

< The good kind of soy sauce

* _A note on the humble egg. There are endless ways to add egg to ramen. Hard-boiled,
scrambled, or fried—they’re all delicious. Look for these recipes in_ The Humble Egg.

_There is one egg variation which you can only do with soup, so we’re listing it here.
Crack the egg into the hot soup, stir it in, and you’ve got a fair approximation of egg-
drop soup. If the water isn’t hot enough to cook the egg in the soup, microwave for a
minute, stir, and repeat until it is cooked. If you’ve made the ramen on a pot on the
stove, then just keep heating until the egg is cooked._


```
FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE
```
< Sriracha

< Frozen vegetables

< Fresh vegetables

**God-Tier Ingredients**
Adding any of these elevates your ramen to next-level shit that tastes
like you’re a fancy lady who went to a restaurant instead of a sad sack
who is crying in front of your TV. We recommend stocking up in between
depressive episodes, especially for things that don’t go bad.

< Garlic

< Onion**

< Ginger

< Chilies

< Kimchi

< Seaweed

< Tofu

< Canned baby corn

< Sesame oil

< Hash browns. _Hash
browns are delicious in
ramen and we don’t know
why. You have to cook
them first before you add them:
see our recipe for_ French Fries a.k.a. Hot Chips.

_**A note on onion preparation. Unless you like raw, crunchy onions, they generally
take a little longer to cook than other vegetables, so you should put them in first. The
smaller they are, the faster they’ll cook, but like some cruel Faustian bargain, the
more you’ll have to work at chopping them. (Unless you buy pre-chopped, of course.)_

_That said, ignore any recipe that tells you to cook until translucent or worse, cook
until brown. That recipe is not for when you have depression, and they will cook just
fine alongside the rest of the ramen as you go._

THE SAD BASTARD COOKBOOK

< Shiitake mushrooms. These come dried, so you need to rehydrate them.
Put them in a jar of water, put that in the fridge, come back to it in a day
or three. Chop up the mushrooms. You probably don’t want to eat the
stem since it will never get soft, but the cap is delicious. The liquid also
makes great stock to add flavour to the ramen soup—use it instead of
water.

< You can do this dried mushroom trick with dried seaweed too. Mix them
together in the jar.

_A word to the wise: Different types of ramen vary as to the vegan-ness, and even
vegetarian-ness, of their ingredients. If this matters to you, it’s a good idea to check
the ingredients closely. Nongshim Soon and Vegetable Mr. Noodles are both vegan._
