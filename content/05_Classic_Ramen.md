Ramen is our ride-or-die. It got us through undergrad, working for poverty wages, and too many depressive episodes to count. It’s cheap, versatile, and takes 5–10 minutes to prepare. You can even eat it dry after smashing it up a bit, with the powder sprinkled on top, if cooking seems like it’s going to take too many spoons.

### Classic Ramen

**Core Ingredients**
- Pack of ramen, a.k.a. instant noodles
- Boiling water

**Preparation I: Stove**
- Dump the ingredients in a pot as the water is boiling, then mix it up.

**Preparation II: Kettle**
- Boil the water in the kettle, add the boiling water, noodles, and flavour package to a bowl, and mix it up.
- Note that the water will be hot enough to cook the noodles but might not defrost any frozen veg that you add. This is why you have a microwave.
- Also note that any measurements on the side of the package are a suggestion, not a rule.

**Preparation III: Microwave**
- Combine water and ramen in a bowl.
- Microwave for 1 min. See if it’s cooked.
- If not, microwave another minute.
- Repeat until cooked.

**Ingredient Tiers**
- **Bottom-Tier Ingredients:** Wilty vegetables, soy sauce packets, hot sauce packets, random spices, or just rawdog it from the package.
- **Mid-Tier Ingredients:** Egg (hard-boiled, scrambled, fried, or egg-drop style), good soy sauce, sriracha, frozen vegetables, fresh vegetables.
- **God-Tier Ingredients:** Garlic, onion, ginger, chilies, kimchi, seaweed, tofu, canned baby corn, sesame oil, hash browns, shiitake mushrooms (rehydrated), or dried seaweed.

### Ramen Variations

**Variation I: Instant Ramen**
- Use any instant ramen brand you like. Nongshim is a favorite, but there are many options.
- Add your choice of ingredients from the tiers above to customize your ramen.

**Variation II: Apocalypse Ramen**
This is like regular ramen soup but with three critical differences:
- It is intensely chaotic, which is to say that you can pretty much toss anything into it and say you did it on purpose.
- It’s slightly healthier, if your depression has lifted enough that you want to eat something other than delicious, delicious chemicals.
- It involves a mason jar, so you can feel like you’re riding out the end of days in true hipster style.

**Core Ingredients & Supplies**
- Mason jar or other heatproof receptacle
- Boiling water
- Rice noodles (cook fast)

**Preparation**
- Put all ingredients in the jar.
- Boil some water.
- Pour into jar to cover ingredients.
- Shake it up a bit (not right away, otherwise you’ll burn your hands and get more depressed).
- Let it sit for a few minutes.
- Enjoy???

**Variations**
- Use takeout packets of hot sauce and soy sauce.
- Add frozen or fresh vegetables (wilty is fine).
- Add any kind of spices (garlic or ginger powder suggested).
- Include tofu or other protein if available.
