## Toast Variations }

_Also called toasties_.

If you live alone, you may struggle to finish a loaf of bread before it goes
bad. This is where toast has a key benefit over ordinary bread. If you buy
pre-sliced bread, you can store the bread in the freezer, take out one slice at
a time, and defrost it in the toaster. This isn’t a particularly Sad-Bastard life
hack, because it’s indistinguishable from toast made from non-frozen bread.
This is the kind of life hack even well-adjusted folk need to know.

We suppose you could also make sandwiches, if you’ve got non-moldy bread
on the counter or in the fridge instead of in the freezer. But that sounds
unlikely.
