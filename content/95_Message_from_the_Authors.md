The electronic version of this cookbook is free because, regardless of life
circumstances, people deserve good food. If we and our community can help
people with that, we want to. Even if it’s as little as sharing recipe ideas.

That said, the _Night Beats_ community contains a lot of authors. Including us!
We authored the cookbook you’re reading _right now_. And some other stuff
too. Rachel A. Rosen published a climate fantasy novel _Cascade (The Sleep of
Reason Book 1)_ and Zilla Novikov has a satire novella, _Query_. And Marten’s got
some great steampunk pilots. You might like them. You like books, right?

If you want to support us, here’s some things you could do to help us as
authors which don’t cost money.

- You could share this book with a friend who could use it.

- You could share this book with your mortal enemy, kicking off a rom-
com-style enemies-to-lovers montage.

- You could subscribe to our newsletter at
https://nightbeatseu.ca/newsletter/

- You could write a review of
this book. Books with more
reviews on websites get recom-
mended to more readers. Go-
odreads, Storygraph, Amazon,
Barnes & Noble, they’re all good.
Write a review telling our bot over-
lords that you like this book, and the
algorithm will tell total strangers
that they might like it too.

- God-Tier: Ask a librarian to buy our
books for your local library. You



```
could use this as a free way to read and review our other books too! How-
ever, this may involve speaking to a librarian, and we cannot advocate
approaching these malevolent beings in the flesh. Only if there is an
online form.
```
But honestly, we don’t need any of that.
Enjoy the cookbook. Know you’re not alone. Share our coping mechanisms.
Take care of yourself as much as you can.
