Potatoes are proof that evolution was a good idea. They’re the ideal
food. You can boil them, bake them, fry them, or turn them into vodka.
Just ask Samwise Gamgee from The Lord of the Rings.

Peeling potatoes is time consuming and dramatically lowers the nutritional
content of the potato. Lots of really nutritious stuff is just below the peel.
We only mention this in case someone tells you that they prefer eating
mashed potatoes without bits of peel. It’s more socially acceptable to talk
about nutrition than it is to explain about depression coping mechanisms.
It shouldn’t be—we should live in a world where mental illness can be
discussed openly. But some days it’s easier to talk about nutrition than to be
the change, and picking your battles is a life skill for an activist.

If you don’t peel the potatoes—and why would you—make sure you wash off
any dirt. Dirt has a terrible texture. Ideally, buy washed potatoes. This is the
only problem that capitalism can solve for you.

**Core Ingredients**
- Potato

**Preparation I: Baked Potato in the Oven**
_Known as a jacket potato in the UK._

- Turn on the oven at 350°F or 175°C or so. Precision is for suckers.

- Put the potato in the oven for three years or until
slightly squishy when you poke it with a fork. _Rohan,
author and professional chef, tells us it takes about an hour,
depending on potato size. Experience tells us that it always
takes longer than you think._

- Take the potato out of the oven.

FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE

- Cut the potato in half and add toppings to both sides. _We suggest you use
oven mitts or a tea towel or a regular towel to avoid burning your hands._

- If you cook extra potatoes, then you’ll have leftovers you can heat up in
the microwave later, or eat cold, or turn into _Bubble and Squeak_. Adding
more potatoes to the oven doesn’t increase the cooking time.

- Baked potato hack: Before putting your potato in the oven, rub it all over
with oil and salt. It will make the skin taste like a big delicious potato
chip.

**Preparation II: Baked Potato in the Microwave**
- Poke the skin of the potato a few times with a fork. This is necessary so
the steam can escape. If you don’t, the steam will explode out of the skin
and coat the inside of the microwave with potato. Also, poking potatoes
with a fork is cathartic.

- Microwave until squishy when you poke it with a fork. The internet says
7–10 minutes but it’ll depend on your specific microwave. It will also
take longer than you think.

- Cut the potato in half and add toppings to both sides.

- Putting more than one potato in the microwave at once will increase the
cooking time.

**Variations**
You can top a baked potato with anything. Classics include:

- Margarine or butter

- Salsa

- Peanut butter

- Baked beans

- Hummus

- Cheese (cheddar, feta, American pseudo-cheese slices.. .)

- Red onion

- Sour cream (yogurt also works)

- Tears (of your enemies?)
