## Fried Plantains }

_Plantains are great. Plus, when they go black, they’re ready to eat. They’re much
more forgiving than bananas, which are kinda gross if you forget about them and
they go black._

**Core Ingredients**
< Plantains

< Butter or margarine or cooking oil

**Preparation**
< Peel and slice the plantain.

< Add the butter to a frying pan.

< Fry over low or medium heat, flipping once so both sides get brown.

< Eat.

_Plantains look similar to bananas, so we tried this with a banana, and it also tasted
good. If only everything that looked similar tasted the same._
