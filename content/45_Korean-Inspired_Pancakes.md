## Korean-Inspired Pancakes }

_We have it on good authority that saying “inspired by” is how you get away with
dubious claims. Unfortunately, eating these pancakes will not magically transport
you to South Korea. They taste pretty okay, though._

**Core Ingredients**
< Pancake batter ingredients. Select your variation of choice from _Pan-
cakes_. _Ideally the batter would be made with water instead of milk, but if you’re
using a mix that has milk, that’s okay._

< Cooking oil

< Green onions (sometimes called spring onions or scallions). We imagine
this works with regular onions up chopped really small, but we’ve never
tried, because no one can be bothered to chop onions that small.

< Soy sauce

**Preparation**
< Make pancake batter.

< Cut up the onion. _Elite hacks: Cut up green vegetables and herbs with scissors
instead of a knife. It’s faster and easier. It works on green onions, but it also
works on nappa cabbage—anything green and thin._

< Add the onion to the batter.

< Add cooking oil to the frying pan. Turn on medium heat.

< Add a scoop of batter to the hot frying pan. Some people use a ladle. We
use the cup measure we got dirty when measuring the flour. Save your-
self washing the ladle.

< Flip when it’s partway cooked and cook a bit longer. _See previous recipe for
when to flip._

< Serve with soy sauce for dipping.

THE SAD BASTARD COOKBOOK
```
**Variations**
< Add other veg as well as onion. You can add anything, but you need to
cut it up small enough to stay inside the pancake instead of instantly fall-
ing out. Napa cabbage is already flat, so it’s a great one. _Cut it with scissors_.
Zucchini and mushroom are both very tasty if you can be bothered to
slice them thin.

< Vary your dipping sauce. For example, instead of soy sauce on a plate,
you could put Sriracha on a plate. Or both! _On the same plate!_

< The Saddest Bastard: if you don’t have onion, or don’t like onion, omit it
and just use some other veg.
