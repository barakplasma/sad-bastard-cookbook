+++

Like smoothies, except you don’t have to make it yourself or clean a blender.

**Core Ingredients**
- Ice cream. That’s it.

- Get the vegan version if you don’t eat dairy.

**Preparation**
- You can eat ice cream out of the tub.

- You don’t even need a spoon.

- Those plastic knives will work in a pinch.

- If you peel the cardboard from around the top, you can eat it like a giant
ice cream cone.
