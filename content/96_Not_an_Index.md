title = "Not an Index"

So here’s the deal: Indexes exist because back in the day, it was impossible to
use a search function to look for recipes in a cookbook which used a specific
ingredient. If you wanted to know how many of the recipes in this book
involve peanut butter, you turned to the back of the book—this section right
here—and you looked up the answer.

That was back in the day when books came on paper, and no one had cell
phones, and you weren’t allowed to use slide rules in math class. Hard times.
But society has moved on. This is the future. Use the search function. If you
only have the paper version of this book, you can get a free e-version on our
website, [http://www.nightbeatseu.ca.](http://www.nightbeatseu.ca.)

If you need to look up how to parboil something, congratulations! You’re
probably feeling better enough that you don’t need this cookbook. Use
Google for that. Or Bing.
