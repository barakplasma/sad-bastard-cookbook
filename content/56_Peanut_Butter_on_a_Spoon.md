## Peanut Butter on a Spoon }

**Core Ingredients**
< Nut butter. _Peanut butter is the cheapest nut butter, but it’s good to have alter-
natives if you’re allergic or your workplace has a peanut butter ban._

**Preparation**
< Eat directly out of the jar, on a spoon.

**Variations**
< Works equally well with other nut butters. _Peanut, almond, Wowbutter,
whatever you like can be substituted in all of these._

< You can also do this with hummus.

< Mix together one-to-one nut butter to honey (or maple syrup if you’re
Canadian/vegan). Eat.

**Non-Spoon Variations**
< Spread on crackers.

< Spread on hard pretzels.

< Spread on soft pretzels.

< Spread on cheddar cheese slices.

< Spread on apple slices.

< Spread on bread, optionally with jam.
