## Couscous Variations }

You can think of couscous like instant rice or instant noodles that come in
a different shape. You can make it with only a kettle, a bowl, and a spoon.
It tastes good with lots of different sauces and lots of different additions.
Most of the things that go well with rice or noodles will also taste good with
couscous. Our personal favourite is to add Moroccan-style flavourings.

**Core Ingredients**
< Couscous

< Boiling water

**Preparation**
< Boil the kettle.

< Put some couscous in a bowl.

< Add boiling water until it just covers the couscous + maybe 1 millimetre.

< Cover the bowl, maybe.
_You can cover the bowl in
cling wrap to keep the heat
in, if you can find the end of
the cling wrap on the roll.
Sounds unlikely. Put a plate
on the top instead, if you’ve
got a clean plate. Fuck it.
Don’t put anything on it.
It’ll cook well enough._

< Wait until the water
looks like it’s absorbed,
then fluff it with a fork.

< Consume.

and/or American, a millimetre is
the smallest unit of measurement
that you can actually see.
