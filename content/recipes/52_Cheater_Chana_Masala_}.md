**Core Ingredients**

- 1 jar tikka masala sauce

- 1 can chickpeas

**Preparation**

- Drain and rinse canned chickpeas.

- Pour into a pot with the jar of tikka masala sauce.

- Simmer until thickened.

**Variations**

- Slice in tomatoes, peppers, or potatoes if you have the spoons for veg.

- Serve over _Rice_ or _Couscous._

**Mid-Tier**

- Pre-made sauce can be expensive. A can of chopped tomatoes with some
  spices is usually much cheaper. We recommend adding a lot of curry
  powder, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of sugar.
