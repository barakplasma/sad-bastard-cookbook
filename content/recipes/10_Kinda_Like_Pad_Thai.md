Peanut butter and sweet chili sauce mix together to make something which tastes kinda like you’d imagine Pad Thai sauce would taste if you’ve never had Pad Thai before. It’s delicious. Real Pad Thai is even more so.

**Core Ingredients**
- Rice noodles
- Boiling water
- Peanut butter
- Sweet chili sauce

**Preparation**
- Cook the rice noodles. You can cook them like _Pasta_ on the stove, but pay attention. Rice noodles cook much faster than wheat noodles. Alternatively, you can cook them like _Apocalypse Ramen_ in a mason jar and drain the water when they’re cooked.
- Add peanut butter and sweet chili sauce to the cooked noodles.
- Stir and eat.
- If the noodles cool down, the sauce might not mix in as well as when they’re hot straight out of the boiling water. You could throw the noodles and sauce in the frying pan with a bit of oil.

**Variations**
- Goes well with a sprinkling of nuts. Peanuts, nut mix, anything really.
- Also good over Italian-style wheat pasta, or other Asian-style noodles, or over instant noodles. See cooking instructions in _Pasta_ or in _Ramen Variations Part II: Instant Noodles on a Plate,_ or on the back of the package.
- Defrost and add frozen vegetables.
- Cook and add fresh vegetables.
- Add a cooked egg. Read _The Humble Egg_ for ideas of how to cook it.
