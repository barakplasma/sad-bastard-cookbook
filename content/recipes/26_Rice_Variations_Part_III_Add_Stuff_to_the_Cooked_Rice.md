title = "Add Stuff to the Cooked Rice"
+++

These can be made with fresh rice, or leftover rice you heat up in the
microwave.

**Core Ingredients**

- Rice (see _Rice Variations Part I_ & _Part II_ for cooking instructions and fla-
  vouring ideas)

**Variations: Flavouring**
Itâ€™s hard to know what to say here. Rice goes with most sauces. Whatever
you have in the cupboard or fridge will probably taste good. Here are some
classics to start you off.

- Soy sauce

- Sesame oil (combines well with soy sauce)

- Any bottle of stir fry sauce. Teriyaki. Hoisin. Black bean. Anything. Mix
  and match.

- Laoganma chili oil

- Canned soup

- Any jar of curry sauce. Korma. Vindaloo.

- Salsa

- Hummus

- Scoop in some butter or margarine with a fork. Bonus: you can then eat
  the rice straight out of the cooker with that buttery fork.

**Variations: Stuff**

- Frozen vegetables. Defrost your vegetables of choice in the microwave
  and add.

```
Note that vindaloo is
spicy, and is not for
the weak of mouth like
Zilla. It may need ex-
tra chilis in it for spice
fiends like Rachel.
```

- Canned beans. As always, drained and rinsed. _We talk about this in_ Bean
  Salad*. Skip ahead. Break the rules.*

- Canned vegetables.

- Chinese preserved vegetables.

- Nuts and seeds.

**Mid-Tier Variations**

- Fresh vegetables, raw. Chunks of fresh tomatoes are really tasty mixed
  with rice, olive oil, and sea salt. Canned chickpeas would be good here
  too.

- Fresh vegetables, cooked. Whatever is in the fridge or pantry. Chop some
  zucchini or carrots, put them in a bowl with a little water in the bottom
  and microwave them. Or fry some mushrooms and onions.

- A humble egg. See _The Humble Egg_ for cooking instructions for fried,
  scrambled, and hard-boiled. Any of these go well with rice.

- Cheese.

_Hot tip: You can mix and match from these rice variations! Add nuts to the top of
instant rice you cooked with a stock cube. Go wild, you beautiful rebel!_
