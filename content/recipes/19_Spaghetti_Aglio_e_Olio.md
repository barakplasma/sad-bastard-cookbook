title = "Spaghetti Aglio e Olio"
+++

Again, God-Tier effort and God-Tier tastiness.

**Core Ingredients**
- Bread or breadcrumbs

- Spaghetti

- Olive oil

- Red chili flakes and salt

- Garlic (fresh chopped, frozen, from a jar, or garlic salt)

- Lemon juice. _Freshly squeezed from that lemon shaped bottle in the door of
your fridge. Or from a real lemon. This is a judgement-free zone._

**Preparation**
- Cook spaghetti according to the package directions. See _Pasta Variations_
for more pasta-related witty banter and maybe some cooking advice.

- Make two slices of toast and cut them into tiny pieces. Unless you have
breadcrumbs, in which case, use them.

- Add toast pieces, garlic, and red chili flakes to a pan with some hot olive
oil and cook until crispy.

- Mix everything together.

- Add salt and lemon juice.
