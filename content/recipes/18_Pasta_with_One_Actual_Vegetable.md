This recipe is also God-Tier since it involves cooking both pasta and spinach.
We only recommend it because it’s tasty.

**Core Ingredients**

- Pasta

- Spinach (frozen or fresh)\*

- Boiling water

- Olive oil

- Cumin powder or cumin seeds (or both)

- Salt

**Preparation**

- Fry spinach in olive oil and cumin until warm, wilted, and soft. Medium
  or low heat is all you need. _You can’t add too much cumin. There’s no such
  thing. That’s just physics._

- Cook pasta.

- Put spinach on pasta. Add a bit more olive oil and some salt.

- Voila! Spinach over pasta.

**Variations**

- Add garlic or onions or whatever to the spinach when you fry it.

- Use zucchini instead of spinach.

* _If you buy fresh spinach, make sure that it comes pre-washed in the bag. Washing
  spinach is far too much effort. If you buy frozen, get the kind that comes in chunks
  not in a giant block. Defrosting the giant block takes an annoyingly long time._

- Or radish greens instead of spinach. They’re basically identical except for
  being cheaper.

- You could do other stuff with the fried spinach too! Serve it over rice.
  Add it to quesadillas. Chuck it in ramen. Hide it in your enemy’s shoes.
  Spinach fried with cumin has countless uses.
