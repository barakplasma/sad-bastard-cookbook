Frozen dumplings are excessively delicious. If you’re lucky, you can get
tasty and cheap ones at your local grocery store. If not, stock up next time
you’re at a specialty Asian grocery store. They come in all kinds of varieties,
as nearly every culture on Earth thought up the brilliant idea of taking tasty
things and wrapping them in dough.

**Core Ingredients**
- Frozen dumplings

**Preparation I: Boiled**
- Boil water in a pot.

- Add frozen dumplings.

- Cook for the length of time it says on the bag.

- Drain and serve.

**Preparation II: Pan-Fried**
- Check the bag to see if there are any instructions about this. _Pro-tip: You
can save yourself some cooking time by microwaving them a bit before frying._

- Pour some oil into the pan and heat the pan on medium. _No, more oil than
that._

- Fry dumplings until golden brown at the bottom, swirling the pan
around a few times.



**God-Tier: Steamed Dumplings**
Steamed dumplings are one of those things that look like they’d be hard
to make but if you happen to have a steamer*, they’re actually faster than
boiling. Frozen dumplings will stick to the bottom of the steamer, so use a
piece of parchment paper (poke some holes in it first) and save yourself the
washing up.

- Select a pot or pan which is the right size for the steamer to sit on top.

- Add water to that pot or pan, and heat it until it’s boiling. You want
enough water that it can boil for ten-ish minutes without all the water
boiling away.

- Put the steamer on top.

- Put the lid on the steamer.

- Leave it there until the dumplings are tasty. There might be suggested
cooking times on the side of the bag.

**Variations**
- A dipping sauce can be nice. Soy sauce is a classic.

- Dumplings make a great addition to other meals to bulk them out and
add variety. Serve with _Rice_ or _Fried Rice,_ or with _Fried Noodles_ or _Instant
Noodles on a Plate_. Or put them in your _Ramen_ soup!

* _Bamboo steamers are amazing, but not everyone is lucky enough to have one. If
you’re unlucky in this regard, poke some holes in parchment paper and line the inside
of a colander with it, and use a lid from a pot to cover it. It’s kinda the same thing.
