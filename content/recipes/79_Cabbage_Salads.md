_Cabbage salad three ways._

**Core Ingredients**
- Cabbage. You can grate it by hand or with a food processor, or just chop
it with a knife into smallish pieces. Or buy it pre-shredded for a low-ef-
fort option.

**Preparation I: Coleslaw**
- Combine shredded cabbage with mayonnaise and a good glug of cider
vinegar or rice vinegar. _Or use another type of vinegar. Whatever is in the
house will work._

- Optional: also grate in some carrots.

- Stir.

- Put it in the fridge until you’re ready to eat it. It’s tastier if you let it sit
for at least half an hour.

**Preparation II: Swedish Pizza Salad**
If you travel to Sweden, or if you’re lucky enough to already be in Sweden,
you might go to a pizzeria and buy yourself a slice. As a side, you might order
a “pizza salad.” This will be that salad.

- Season shredded cabbage with salt and sugar until you’re satisfied with
the flavour.

- Add a glug of vegetable oil and a glug of white vinegar. _Or use another type
of vinegar if you don’t have white vinegar at home._

- Add a good grind of black pepper and a pinch of oregano.

- Stir through and put it in the fridge until you’re ready to eat it.

- This makes excellent leftovers—it’s even better day two.



**Preparation III: Bottom-Tier Japanese Addictive Cabbage**
- Season shredded cabbage with the powder from your instant ramen
noodles.

- Add a glug of rice vinegar or any other vinegar you’ve got around the
house.

- Crumble raw ramen noodles into salad.

- Stir and consume.

**Preparation IV: God-Tier Japanese Addictive Cabbage**
Depending on where you live, you might be looking at a trip to an Asian
grocery store to buy wonton-soup powder and Chinese sesame paste. If you
can’t get all these ingredients, you can mix-and-match from Bottom-Tier and
God-Tier to make your own delicious salad variation.

- Season shredded cabbage with wonton-soup powder.

- Add Chinese sesame paste and rice vinegar.

- Add minced garlic or dried garlic flakes.

- Add sesame seeds. You can toast these first by heating them in a wee
frying pan.

- Stir and enjoy.
