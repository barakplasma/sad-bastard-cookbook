**Core Ingredients**
- Bread

- Garlic (powdered is fine)

- Some type of oil-substance. Butter, margarine, vegetable oil, olive oil. All
good.

**Preparation**
- Take bread.

- Put oil-substance (butter, margarine, vegetable oil, or olive oil) on the
non-crust part of the bread.

- Put garlic on top. This could be powdered garlic, garlic squeezed from a
tube, maybe even freshly minced garlic. If you’re using something liquid
(melted butter/margarine or oil), you can mix the garlic in with it for
easier spreading.

- Ideally, bake in the oven at 350°F (175°C) until hot and deliciously toasty.
We recommend wrapping it up in tinfoil first, but this is not compulsory.

- If using the oven is too much for today, you can microwave it instead to
melt the margarine and heat the bread. No one can stop you.

**Variations**
- You can make this on really fancy bread like on a baguette or on part-
baked rolls from the freezer. Or on slices of whatever loaf is in your
freezer.

- Put cheese on top before you cook it.

- You don’t actually need to heat the bread when making garlic bread. It’s
delicious at room temperature.

- If you’re having a great day, make extra and freeze it before it’s baked.
You can wrap it in tin foil for the freezer like a fancy grocery store
would. Then you’ve got garlic bread on hand to bake for emergencies.
