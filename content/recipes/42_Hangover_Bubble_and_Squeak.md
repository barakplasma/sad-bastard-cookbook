title = "Hangover Bubble and Squeak"
+++

**Core Ingredients**
- Potato (These should be already cooked.
You can use any remnants of the _Baked
Potato_ recipe.)

- Cooking oil or butter

- Salt and pepper

- The rest of your leftovers

**Preparation**
- Put oil or melt butter in a frying pan on
medium heat. If you’re using onions, let them get a head start with the
frying.

- Mash up the potatoes with a fork or the edge of your spatula if they’re
not already mashed.

- Dump in the potatoes and any other ingredients and fry for about 10
minutes. Keep pressing everything down with your spatula or whatever
you have.

- Flip it over and add some salt and pepper. Fry for another few minutes.
You’re aiming for golden brown but we’ll settle for not burnt.

- If you’re using an egg, drop it in right at the end to quickly fry.

**Mid-Tier**
- Chopped onions

- Fried egg

- Any chopped vegetables. You can use frozen vegetables as well but it’ll
take a bit longer.

- Some British people will tell you that _Bubble and Squeak_ needs to include cabbage, spinach, or some other green. They can think that. We have
nothing against the British people, only their fascist governments.

Rachel learned this recipe from a
roommate following a night of
unhealthy imbibing. Upon looking
it up, it turns out that Bubble
and Squeak is an actual British
dish and not something said
roommate just made up to mess
with her. This is a lazy version of
that, designed to use up leftovers
in your fridge before they go bad.
Remember those baked potatoes
you made the other day? Here’s
what you do with any that you
have left.

**God-Tier**
- The God-Tier version of fried potato bits is called latkes, which you should
look up and make when you’re feeling better.
