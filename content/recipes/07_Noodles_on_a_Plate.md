### Ramen Variations Part II: Instant Noodles on a Plate

**Core Ingredients**

- Pack of ramen, a.k.a. instant noodles\*
- Boiling water

**Preparation**

- Make your instant noodles with boiling water from the kettle, or by boiling them on the stove like pasta.
- Resist! Do not add the flavour package yet!
- When noodles are soft enough to eat, drain the water.
- Serve on a plate instead of in a bowl.
- Add flavour package to taste. You can always add more, but it’s hard to add less. Stir it in.

**Mid-Tier Ingredients**

- Sauces. You can substitute the flavour package with sweet chili sauce, or anything else you like.
- Basically everything we said was tasty in ramen-as-soup is also tasty in instant-noodles-on-a-plate. _For big stuff like frozen veg or fresh veg, add it to the boiling water. Small stuff like garlic will escape out the strainer when you drain it, so that goes on the plate._

**God-Tier Ingredients**
_For God-Tier, you’re frying some ingredients separately, and thus making a second dish dirty. The oil is necessary for frying success—the rest are all optional to choose between._

- Oil
- Garlic
- Onion
- Peppers
- Mushrooms
- Frozen veg mix

**God-Tier Preparation**

- Put some oil in a frying pan. Put on medium heat.
- Loosely chop garlic, and/or half an onion, and/or half a pepper and other tasty things like that.
- Mushrooms are great.
- If you don’t want to chop fresh vegetables, you can use frozen veg here.
- Fry the veg in the frying pan. A minute or two?
- Add the cooked noodles and whatever sauce you’re using, which might be the flavour package.
- Stir.
- Serve on a plate! Or eat it out of the pan.

- _Irish readers, consider making this with koka noodles. We have been informed this is your equivalent to what Canadians call ramen._
