_You know that thing where you freeze chunks of banana and then put them in a
blender and make fake ice cream? This is that, but without the blender._

**Core Ingredients**

- Greek yogurt

- Bananas

**Preparation**

- Take a cup or so of Greek yogurt.

- Take two bananas or so.

- Mash them together with a fork, or a masher, or a blender if you’ve got
  one of those.

- Stick in the freezer.

- Stir with a fork after 40 minutes or so.

- Stir again every 40 mins or so until frozen solid and smooth. It’s okay if
  you forget sometimes. This process probably takes three to five stirring
  sessions, so this is a “start it in the afternoon and it’s ready by the eve-
  ning” food.

- That’s it. That’s all you need to do.

**Bottom-Tier**

- Don’t stir it. It’s not actually necessary.

**Variations**

- Add some chocolate powder or chocolate sauce.
