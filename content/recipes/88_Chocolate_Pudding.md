This recipe is good enough to serve to guests. It’s good enough to include even though it has actual measurements. And we don’t measure ingredients lightly. Or at all—we include a cheat underneath.

**Core Ingredients**
- ½ cup sugar
- ½ cup cocoa powder
- 3 Tbsp. cornstarch
- 2 cups water

_Here’s the thing. You can do this as ratios. For every 1 measure of cornstarch, add 3 of sugar, 3 of cocoa and 12 of water. This works no matter whether you use a tablespoon, or a cup, or a leftover cream-cheese tub as your measure. However, if you use a cup measure for your ratios, you’ll need a very large bowl to hold the 19 cups of stuff._

**Preparation**
- Stir together the dry ingredients (everything besides the water).
- Add the water.
- More stir.
- Microwave for 1 minute then stir.
- Repeat until it’s pudding.
- Put it in the fridge.
- Ideally wait until it gets to fridge temperature to eat it, but we don’t judge. But it will taste even better. Promise.

**Bottom-Tier**
- You can use instant hot chocolate powder instead of a mix of sugar and cocoa. It might only work with specific brands of instant powder; we haven’t tested it with every brand ever invented. In fact, we tested it only with the absolute cheapest store-brand instant hot chocolate powder, but the important thing is that it worked.

**God-Tier**
- Substitute milk or milk equivalent instead of water.
- Defrost frozen fruit. Add it to the pudding when it’s done.
- Add fresh fruit to the pudding when it’s done.

_A note for our British friends: In Canada, pudding is a slightly thicker version of custard. We know that it means “any dessert” in your country. Your country has a lot to answer for already._
