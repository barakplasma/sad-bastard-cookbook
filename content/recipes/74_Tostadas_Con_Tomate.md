title = "Tostadas Con Tomate"
+++

This meal sounds much fancier if you don’t know enough Spanish to
translate it as tomatoes on toast.

**Core Ingredients**
- Bread

- Tomatoes

- Salt

- Olive oil or butter or margarine or mayonnaise

**Preparation I: Sliced Tomatoes**
- Toast bread.

- Spread butter, margarine, or mayonnaise on the toast—or drizzle olive
oil over it.

- Add tomato slices.

- Sprinkle with salt.

- Optional: add a second slice of toast on top.

**Preparation II: Grated Tomatoes**
- Toast bread.

- Drizzle toast with olive oil.

- Grate the tomato with the cheese grater so you get a tomato mush. You
want to do this over a plate, not over the kitchen counter.

- Put the tomato mush on the bread.

- Sprinkle with salt.

- If you’ve got dried oregano, sprinkle that on too.
