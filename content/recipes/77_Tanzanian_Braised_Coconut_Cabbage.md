This is the kind of real recipe which has real measurements. Feel free to
ignore them. We do.

**Core Ingredients**

- One red onion. The colour is nice but not essential.

- Cooking oil (¼ cup or a few glugs from the bottle)

- Cabbage (whole cabbage, ideally pre-cut into 1-inch wedges)

- Coconut milk (1 cup but realistically just put in the whole can)

- Salt

- Pepper

**Preparation**

- Chop a red onion, unless you bought pre-chopped onion.

- Chop a cabbage into pieces, unless you were able to buy a pre-chopped
  cabbage.

- In a large saucepan, sauté onions in all the oil until soft.

- Add cabbage and cook, stirring, until cabbage loses its crispness.

- Stir in coconut milk and season with salt and pepper.

- Simmer for 5 minutes.

**Variations**

- You can make this with most other vegetables, fresh or frozen.

- Serve with _Rice_ or _Couscous_.
