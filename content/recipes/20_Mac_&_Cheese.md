title = "Mac & Cheese"
+++

Most Canadians will tell you that macaroni and cheese is the ultimate
comfort food. We call it mac and cheese for short, or Kraft Dinner, shortened
to KD, even when we don’t buy the Kraft-branded box. Other countries have
boxed pasta and cheese, and sometimes it’s even branded as Kraft Dinner.
But it doesn’t taste the same as the Canadian version. KD might be the only
thing this colonialist country got right.

**Core Ingredients**

- Box of store-bought mac & cheese

- Milk

- Butter

**Preparation**

- Boil water on stove

- Add the pasta from the box. The result will be less sad if you stir it at
  least once.

- When the pasta is cooked, drain the water.

- Add milk and butter to the pot. Don’t measure. Add the package of
  strangely orange cheese powder to the pot. Add the noodles back to the
  pot. Stir. _All of this can be done in any order._

- Stir some more.

- If the butter isn’t melting, you can turn the burner back on low to melt
  the butter.

- If you added far too much milk, that’s okay. Cheese soup with pasta is
  great too.

- You can eat this from the pot, or you can put it in a bowl, or even on a
  plate.

**Variations**
You can do anything with mac and cheese. It’s magic.

- Add ketchup.

- Or salsa.

- Or garlic powder.

- Or fresh garlic.

- Or broccoli.

- Or hummus.

- A splash of soy sauce is a surprisingly good addition.

- People will look at you funny if you add honey, but it has been known to
  happen.

- Live your best life.
