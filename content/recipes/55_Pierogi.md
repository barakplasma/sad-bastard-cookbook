These are tasty potato-filled packages. The freshly made ones are heavenly,
but even the frozen ones are pretty damn good. Hopefully they’re for sale
in the freezer section of your local grocery store. If not, find a specialty
international grocery store which carries Polish food and stock up.

They cook exactly like dumplings, even though they taste different.

**Core Ingredients**
- Frozen pierogi

**Preparation I: Boiled**
- Boil water in a pot.

- Add frozen pierogi.

- Cook for the length of time it says on the bag.

- Drain and serve.

**Preparation II: Pan-Fried**
- Check the bag to see if there are any instructions about this. _Pro-tip: You
can save yourself some cooking time by microwaving them a bit before frying._

- Pour some oil into the pan and heat the pan on medium. _No, more oil than
that._

- Fry the pierogi until golden brown at the bottom, swirling the pan
around a few times.

**Variations**
- If you add cheese when you fry them, they will get deliciously cheesy.

- Serve with sauerkraut and/or chopped pickles.

- Serve with yogurt or sour cream. Yogurt is basically the same as sour
cream and you can use it for more things later. Like _Parfait._

In the interests of laziness, we’re
cutting and pasting the prep instructions.
The Variations are totally different
though, we promise. Well, mostly
different. Look, writing a cookbook is
harder than you’d think, and none of us
majored in Cookbook Writing.

- Add pierogi to _Canned Soup_ to bulk it up.

- If you have a Ukrainian Church nearby, they might sell homemade piero-
gi, which are one of the best things you’ve ever eaten. Blueberry pierogi
changed Zilla’s life.
