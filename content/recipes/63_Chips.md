**Core ingredients**

- Chips

**Preparation**

- Same as cereal, but with a bag.

- Only difference: Do not pour chips into a bowl with milk. Not even with oat milk.

**Variations**

- Rachel has a bowl shaped like a skull and feels less depressed when she
  can eat chips out of that, pretending she’s eating from the skull of an
  enemy.

- Dip into salsa. Traditionally done with nacho chips, but we’re not cow-
  ards. Any chip will do.

- Dip into refried beans from a can. You can heat them up first in the mi-
  crowave if you want to.

- Dip into guacamole. Buy it from a store, or our recipe for _College Guacamo-
  le_ is a delicious and not especially complicated version to make.

- Dip into hummus.

- Chip sandwich. _Or, in Ireland, a crisps sandwich!_ Spread butter or margarine
  on two slices of bread, put chips in between, and enjoy.

- Chip sandwich, but this time with peanut butter instead of butter.

Zilla believes that chips in a skull bowl are an ideal dish to serve at your
affinity group’s potluck. They provide much needed fuel and saltiness when
you’re gearing up for civil disobedience or navigating an in-group love
rhombus. Read Query to find out other things Zilla would do under those
circumstances.
