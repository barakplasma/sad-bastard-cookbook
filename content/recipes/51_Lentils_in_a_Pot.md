**Core Ingredients**
- Canned lentils (this makes good leftovers, so consider making two cans if
your pot has space).

- Water

- Salt

**Preparation**
- Drain the liquid from the can.

- Rinse the lentils, probably in the can. _Lentils are wee and some of them will
escape. It’s okay._

- Pour the lentils into the pot. Add maybe a can of water for every can of
lentils. If you want it thicker, add less water. If you want it more soup-
like, add more.

- Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally so the lentils on the bottom
don’t burn. Add more water if it gets thicker than you want it to be.

- If you add a lot of water and cook it just long enough to heat it, congratu-
lations, you’ve made lentil soup!

- If you add less water and cook it until the lentils get really mushy, good
job on your lentil stew.

- Add salt, more than you think you need.

**Variations**
- This also works with chickpeas instead of lentils.

- Lentils also come dried—you’ll need more water and much more time if
you want to do it this way, though.

- Salt is great, but what about adding other spices too? Like pepper and
curry powder? Or chili flakes? If you can get a hold of berbere, a fantastic
Ethiopian and Eritrean spice mix, it works really well for this.

- Add a can of crushed tomatoes. Or some tomato paste from a tube.

- Add garlic and onions when you add the lentils. You can get these pre-
chopped and frozen.

- Fresh garlic hack: Throw three or four garlic cloves into the water with
the beans. Let them cook alongside the beans. Fish them out of the soup,
and squeeze them out of their peels by hand. Stir the delicious garlic
paste into the soup.

- Add frozen vegetables with the lentils. Frozen spinach is excellent here.

- Fresh vegetables need to cook for a bit longer, but they’ll be a tasty addi-
tion.

- Add root vegetables if you can commit to standing beside the stove until
they cook. Chop some potatoes, carrots, or sweet potatoes. You have to
wash them but you don’t have to peel them.

- Serve over _Rice_ or _Couscous_.
