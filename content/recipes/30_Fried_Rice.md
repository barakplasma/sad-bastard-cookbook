This is our favourite thing to do with leftover rice. It’s so delicious and easy
that sometimes we’ll cook fresh rice just so we can make fried rice. But the
true genius of this recipe is turning leftovers into a solid meal.

**Core Ingredients**
- Cooked rice, hot or cold

- Oil

**Preparation**
- Add oil to the frying pan.

- Turn on to medium heat.

- If you have fresh or frozen vegetables, add them now and fry them. Stir
sometimes so everything cooks and nothing burns. Ideally don’t overfill
the pan now—you want to leave room for the rice.

- Add the rice to the frying pan.

- Add more oil. This ain’t health food.

- Stir occasionally so all the rice has a chance to fry.

- If you want to add sauce, now is the time to pour it on the rice and stir it
through.

- Eat!

**Variations**
All the flavouring and vegetables stuff we suggested you could add to rice
in _Rice Variations Part II & Part III_ are good here too. Instead of repeating
ourselves, here’s a few things which are specifically good on fried rice.

- You really want some kind of sauce on this. If you’ve got any soy sauce
around, put it on.



- Our personal favourite fried rice sauce is soy sauce and sesame oil.

- Garlic and onions. Add these during the vegetable step. You can buy pre-
chopped.

- Fresh or frozen vegetables. Sliced mushrooms are amazing here.

- Tofu chunks. Add during the vegetable step so you can fry them. Firm
tofu preferred.

- Egg. There’s a special egg variation only available to fried rice. Here’s
the secret. After you add the rice, crack an egg on top. Stir it through as
you stir the rice. The egg will coat the rice grains, giving the fried rice a
lovely eggy flavour.

- Spices as seasonings. You can add these during the vegetable step or
during the sauce step. We do it during the sauce step because we’re bad
at estimating how much spice we’ll want until we see it on the rice. Cur-
ry powder is a personal favourite.
