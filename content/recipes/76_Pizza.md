This is much, much tastier if you make it in the oven than the microwave.
But it’s still good in the microwave, and the nutritional content is the same.

**Core Ingredients**
- Bread-like substance. Bagels are highly
encouraged, but pita bread is great here too.
_We’ve heard that it’s even possible to make this
using pizza dough, but that sounds fake._

- Tomato sauce

- Cheese

**Preparation**
- Take a bagel or other bread-like-substance.

- Put tomato-based pasta sauce on top.

- Put cheese on top, if you’re using cheese.

- Cook in the microwave in 30-second intervals or in the oven until the
cheese melts and/or the bagel is hot. _If you’re cooking this in the oven, put
the pizza bagel in the oven on broil, but don’t go anywhere! Broil will melt the
cheese and cook the bagel to a delicious crispiness very fast, so keep a close eye
on it. For our Irish friends, broil is Very Hot. Use 200°C._

**Variations**
- Italian spice mix on top of the pasta sauce
is the secret ingredient of top-quality pizza
bagels.

- Anything you like to eat on pizza can go on
a pizza bagel.

Vegan cheese would work here, but the tastiest
vegan cheeses are often kinda expensive. Or you
could omit the cheese entirely.
