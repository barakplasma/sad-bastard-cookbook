**Core Ingredients**
- Can of soup

- Sometimes the side of the can tells you a type of liquid to combine with
the soup

**Preparation**
- Check on the side of the soup can to see if you add liquid.

- Open soup can.

- If you don’t need to add anything, pour the soup in the bowl until that
bowl is full.

- If you need to add liquid, don’t fill the bowl more than halfway with the
canned soup. Then add the liquid and stir. _Don’t measure._

- Put the bowl in the microwave for 1-minute intervals until hot.

- If you stir every minute, you are less likely to end up with soup all over
the inside of your microwave.

**Variations**
You can add basically anything at this point:
- Cooked rice, couscous, or pasta. _See our recipes for these:_ Rice _,_ Couscous _,
and_ Pasta_._

- Seeds

- Canned chickpeas or other canned beans. Drained and rinsed, please.

- Hot sauce

- Specific flavours of soup will taste better with certain additions than oth-
ers, but it’s all the same in your stomach. Don’t be afraid to experiment.

- Cook Pierogi and add them to the soup.



- A friend once served Zilla canned lentil soup but he drizzled olive oil
over the soup in the bowl and then topped it with a few leaves of fresh
parsley and she legit thought he’d made it from scratch.

**Bottom-Tier: Even Less Complicated**
We often eat soup from the can without bothering to heat it up. We don’t
even open the can the whole way. That way, it has two hinges and opens like
the Skydome and you’re Godzilla with a spoon.

- Eat cold out of the can.

Rachel notes that it hasn’t been called the
Skydome for 20 years. She also notes that
she will continue to call it the Skydome
regardless.
