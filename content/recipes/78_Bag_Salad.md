This is easy to make, but it assumes you have lettuce in the
fridge. Salad greens go bad fast. You probably went to the
grocery store recently to cook this.

**Core Ingredients and Supplies**
- Pre-chopped lettuce or other salad greens. These usually come in a bag.

- Salad dressing. Some bags of salad come with a salad dressing inside.
That’s one less decision you have to make.

**Preparation I**
- Put salad greens onto the plate or into the bowl you plan to eat from.

- Add toppings as desired.

- Pour on salad dressing.

**Preparation II: Elite Salad Hack**
- Shove lettuce and toppings into a Ziploc bag.

- Add dressing.

- Close bag.

- Shake.

- Consume. The contents, not the bag.

**Variations**
- Add nuts.

- Add seeds.

- Add dried fruit.

- Add fresh fruit.

- Add canned beans. Probably chickpeas.

- Add olives.

- Add cheese. Feta, blue cheese, or cheddar are tops in salad.

- Add black beans, guacamole, and salsa to make a taco salad.

- If you’re feeling fancy, chop up whatever fresh vegetables are in the
fridge.

**God-Tier**
- Pour olive oil over the salad, then pour any vinegar over the salad**.** Voilà!
Homemade salad dressing. _Pre-mixing the salad dressing by shaking the
components together in a jar is nice, but unnecessary. And you’d need to wash
the jar._

- This also works with lemon juice instead of vinegar.

_Pro-tip: If you use olive oil & balsamic vinegar or lemon juice and then add sea salt,
your guest will be incredibly impressed with your chef-ly prowess._
