title = "Fried Noodles"
+++

You make these exactly like you make _Fried Rice_ , but using noodles. Some
people call them “Greasy Noodles” which gives you an idea how much oil
these noodles can take.

**Core Ingredients**
- Cooked noodles, hot or cold

- Oil

**Preparation**
- Add oil to the frying pan.

- Turn on to medium heat.

- If you have fresh or frozen vegetables, add them now and fry them. Stir
sometimes so everything cooks and nothing burns. Ideally don’t overfill
the pan now—you want to leave room for the noodles. _Watch your arms
and for the love of all things edible, don’t do this shirtless._

- Add the noodles to the frying pan.

- Add more oil. This isn’t health food. Another glug or two. Or three.

- Stir occasionally so all the noodles have a chance to fry.

- If you want to add sauce, now is the time to pour it on the noodles and
stir it through.

- Eat!

**Variations**
Literally do the things we told you to do with _Fried Rice_. The only difference
is that you’ve got to pick a type of noodle to use. Decisions are hard, so we
recommend getting a d6 dice, assigning a number to each type of noodle you
have in the house, and rolling for it.

This is almost exactly the Fried Rice
preparation but with “rice“ replaced
by “noodles.“ Look, we promised easy,
not creative.

FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE
```
- Udon noodles can be used straight out of the package without cooking
them first.

- Rice noodles can be cooked using only hot water from the kettle—see the
instructions in _Apocalypse Ramen_ or _Kinda Like Pad Thai_.

- You could take the noodles out of a pack of instant noodles and use
those. See cooking instructions in _Ramen Variations_ or _Instant Noodles on a
Plate_.

- Any Asian-style noodle will be amazing, but mostly you’ll need to cook
them on the stove with boiling water. There’ll be instructions on the
back of the package.

- Italian-style wheat noodles will work in a pinch.

Send noods instead of nudes. Mail these to your friends. Fried noodles
spark joy.
