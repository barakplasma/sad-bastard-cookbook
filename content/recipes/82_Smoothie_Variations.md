Smoothies are excellent for those depressive episodes where you’re too
exhausted to function, as you can get calories and nutrients into your body
without even bothering to chew.

**Core Ingredients and Supplies**
- Blender

- Fruit, like raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries. _We particularly rec-
ommend frozen fruit, as it’s cheaper and lasts longer, and will make the smoothie
cold and refreshing._

- Juice or milk or some other liquid

**Preparation**
- Put fruit in the blender.

- Add some liquid.

- Blend.

- If it’s too thick to blend, or if you want it less thick when you drink it,
add more liquid.

- If it’s not sweet enough, add sugar or honey or banana or something else
that’s sweet.

**Variations**
You can put almost anything in a smoothie. Will it blend? If you have a good
blender, yes. Will it taste good? We leave this question as an exercise for the
Reader.

- Banana, fresh

- Banana which you put in the freezer when you realised it was going
black. You need to peel it, but you don’t need to defrost it before you
blend it.

- Frozen fruit



- Fresh fruit

- Yogurt

- Fresh or frozen avocado??

- Fresh or frozen spinach???

- Protein powder

- Chocolate powder

- Peanut butter

- Sugar

- Honey

- Maple syrup

- Other?????

_Pro-tip: Washing blenders is really annoying unless you rinse them off right away
when you’re done using them. If you don’t have the energy for this, consider letting
them soak in water before you wash them. You can invest in something like a
NutriBullet that is simpler to clean. If you really, really hate washing blenders, make
something else._
