This will impress a guest, possibly because it involves actual cooking.

**Core Ingredients**
- Brie or Camembert cheese. The cheapest you can find is perfect.

- Crackers, any type.

**Preparation I: By the Wheel**
- You’re gonna fully melt the cheese, so you need it to have a rind to con-
tain it in the oven.

- Ideally your baking dish has edges so it acts as an extra layer of con-
tainment. Especially if you pour a liquid like maple syrup on top before
baking.

- Put in the oven at 350°F or 175°C. It’ll probably take about 15 minutes.

- Serve with crackers. Guests will expect a knife to spread the cheese on
the crackers but you can dip if you’re not a coward.

**Preparation II: By the Cracker**
- Put slices of the cheese on crackers on a baking tray.

- Put in the oven at 350°F or 175°C for just long enough to make the cheese
melty. Maybe 5 minutes?

**Variations**
Add any of these on top of the cracker or the cheese before baking.

- Maple syrup.

- Dried cranberries.

- Walnuts or other nuts.

- Jam. _Peach jam and chopped habanero peppers are a particularly good flavour
combination with brie, and you can feel fancy eating it!_
