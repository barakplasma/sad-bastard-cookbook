title = "Black Beans & Rice"

This is probably two or three meals for one person, and it reheats well. It
doesn’t require much use of hands, or lifting anything heavy, because that’s
a shape of disability accommodation we sometimes need.

**Core Ingredients**
- Rice

- Canned black beans

- Spices as desired

- Salsa or tomato paste or hummus

**Preparation**
- Make rice or use already made leftover rice. If it’s not hot, microwave it.

- Drain and rinse a can of black beans.

- Put the beans in a microwave-safe bowl.

- Add any spice or seasoning mix you have handy to the beans. _We like
smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and/or black pepper, but you can use any-
thing from oregano to a chili seasoning mix._

- Microwave the beans until they’re as hot as you like (a couple of min-
utes, probably).

- Mix the rice and beans.

- You can add salsa, any kind you have around, or a bit of tomato paste, or
hummus. _Try the kind of tomato paste that comes in tubes—it’s perfect when
you only want a little._

- Stir and eat.



**God-Tier: Almost Like Rice and Peas**
Authentic rice and peas are a staple of Jamaican cuisine and taste amazing.
This is not that.

- Instead of canned black beans, use kidney beans.

- Instead of water to cook the rice, use coconut milk. (See _Rice Variations
Part II_ for an in-depth description of making rice with coconut milk.)

- Add scallions, thyme, allspice, and scotch bonnet pepper or sauce.
