title = "Quesadillas & Pumpki-dillas Part I: The Basics"
+++

If you’re vegan, you probably don’t want to make the cheese version. Check
out the _Pumpki-dilla_ Variation instead.

When it comes to the type of wrap you use, we’re not purists. If the “wrap”
in the bread aisle is cheaper than the “tortilla,” use that.

**Core Ingredients**
- Tortilla or other wrap-like food substance

- Oil

- Cheese, probably cheddar, probably shredded, AND/OR,

- Canned pumpkin, AND/OR,

- Sweet potato

**Preparation: Quesadilla**
- Take a tortilla, sprinkle half of it generously with grated cheese, fold
over.

- Put a bit of oil in a frying pan and heat on medium.

- Cook on both sides in the frying pan until a little bit browned and the
cheese is melted.

- Or microwave the quesadilla for 30 seconds.

**Preparation: Pumpki-dilla**
Canned pumpkin or mashed sweet potatoes make an incredible filling, and
they hold the quesadilla together even without cheese. If you’re vegetarian,
you can add this to your regular quesadilla, but it’s a great alternative for
vegans.

- Take a tortilla, spread canned pumpkin on one side, fold over.

- Put a bit of oil in a frying pan and heat on medium.

- Cook on both sides in the frying pan until a little bit browned.

- Or microwave the pumpki-dilla for 30 seconds.

**Variation: Boiled Sweet Potato**
- Wash the sweet potato.

- Chop the sweet potato into chunks so it boils faster. _Alternatively, buy the
pre-chopped sweet potato—a little pricier, but it’ll save you effort._

- Boil until squishy.

- Mash with a fork. You can take off the skin at this point but why bother.

- Apply like canned pumpkin.

**Variation: Microwaved Sweet Potato**
- Wash the sweet potato.

- Pierce the sweet potato skin with a fork a few times so the sweet potato
doesn’t explode in the microwave.

- Microwave 7–10 minutes or so, until squishy.

- Scoop out the insides with whatever not-completely-filthy utensil is
closest at hand. _You can eat the skin, but it gets a weird texture in the micro-
wave._

- Apply like canned pumpkin.

_Pro-tip: Wraps don’t freeze particularly well—they stick together in the freezer, tear
when you defrost them, and thus become unwrappable. If you’ve got leftovers to use
up, the_ Wraps _recipes are perfect for you._
