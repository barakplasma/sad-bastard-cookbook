title = "Moroccan Oranges"

_Actual Moroccan oranges with cinnamon are a delicious fancy dessert that also
involves powdered sugar and orange blossom water. But you are a Sad Bastard and
you can get that awesome taste with even lower effort. This genuinely tastes good and
is an excellent source of Vitamin C._

**Core Ingredients**

- Oranges

- Cinnamon

**Preparation**

- Slice the oranges over a bowl so that none of the juice escapes. Ideally slice thinly. Don’t bother peeling them yet.

- Sprinkle cinnamon in the bowl and stir the whole thing up.

- Let it sit for a bit. The juice and cinnamon will mix together to form a delicious goo-like substance which sticks to the orange slices.

- Take out the orange slices and sprinkle more cinnamon over them.

- Eat! You probably don’t want to eat the peel.
