## Potato Variations Part IV: French Fries }

_Also known as “hot chips.”_

**Core Ingredients**
< Potatoes, washed, OR

< Any type of frozen-potato-substance (fries, hash browns, tater tots, waf-
fle fries a.k.a. potato waffles, etc.), OR

< Sweet potatoes

< Oil. _If you’re in Canada, probably canola oil. We’re not sure what other countries
use for their generic cheap vegetable oil._

< Salt

**Preparation I: Starting with Raw Potatoes or Sweet Potatoes**
< Consider your life choices. Raw potatoes are much cheaper than frozen,
and they store for a long time in the dark (for example, in the fridge or
in the pantry). But they take much longer to cook. And you need to chop
them up yourself.

< Okay, so you’re going with raw?

< Wash and chop potatoes. _If you chop them into cubes, call them “home fries.”
If you chop them into longbois, call them “French fries.” Or “hot chips” in Ire-
land._

**Preparation II: Starting with Frozen-Potato-Substance**
< Dig the half-full bag of store-brand French fries out
from the bottom of your freezer.

**Variation: Fries in a Frying Pan**
You need to stand near the frying pan as it cooks, and pay some attention. If
you don’t stir occasionally, the bottom of the fries will burn before the tops
cook at all.

Speaking as younger Gen Xers and older
Millennials, all we know is eat hot chip and lie.

```
Yes, you have
half a bag.
Trust us, it’s
there.

FOOD YOU CAN MAKE SO YOU DON’T DIE
```
< Add oil to the frying pan. Several glugs. And add more during cooking if
the pan looks low. You want enough oil that the bottom of all the pota-
toes are in oil, but not enough to cover their tops, because that would be
deep frying and that’s not _Sad Bastard_ level.

< Add chopped potatoes or whatever frozen-potato-substance you have.

< Cook on medium.

< Stir occasionally. You want to leave it still long enough to get crispy, but
not long enough that the bottom turns to charcoal and the fire alarm
goes off.

< When it achieves desired crispiness levels, turn off the stove and put the
fries on a plate.

< Add salt and enjoy.

**Variation: Fries in the Oven**
< Put the chopped raw or frozen-potato-substance in a pan or on a baking
sheet with raised edges.

< Pour a bit of oil over the potatoes. Use your hand to mix the oil and the
potatoes on the pan so they all get some.

< Bake at 350°F or 175°C.

< Halfway through cooking, take them out of the oven and stir so both
sides get cooked. _If you’re cooking a frozen-potato-substance, it might give you
a time on the bag. Otherwise, it’s probably about 20–25 minutes, so check on them
after every ten minutes or so and give them a stir. Set a timer so you don’t forget
and end up with burnt fries._

< When they have reached the desired crispiness level, salt and eat.

**Variation: Fries in the Microwave**

< Put frozen-potato-substance on a plate.

< Microwave until no longer frozen.

< You’re going to want to add more salt than that to make up for the
texture.

```
These are not, strictly
speaking, good. But they’re a
step up from eating French
fries still frozen straight
out of the bag.
