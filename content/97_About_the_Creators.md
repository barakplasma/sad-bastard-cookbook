**Zilla Novikov** screams into the void on a regular basis. When she’s on Tum-
blr as zillanovikov, the void screams back. When she’s writing for the Night
Beats blog and newsletter (www.nightbeatseu.ca), the void gives her a high
five. You can find her satirical novella Query at [http://www.traumbooks.com.](http://www.traumbooks.com.)

**Rachel a. RoseN** is an activist, graphic designer, and for her sins, a high school
teacher. Through magic dark as Vantablack, she has somehow conjured the
time to write a book series, _The Sleep of Reason_. Check out her first novel,
_Cascade,_ at bppress.ca or, you know, the other online places books are sold.
Find her on Instagram @rachelarosen, or visit her website rachelrosen.ca.

**MaRteN NoRR** is a queer sci-fi/fantasy writer, full-time artist, purveyor of
weird stuff, and little herald of chaos. He’s famous on TikTok for 1) sin-
gle-handedly destroying his grandmother’s legacy, and 2) making the world
aware that the reason there are so few mummies left in the world is because
the Victorians ate them all. Learn more tru fax from Marten on Twitter at
