**Preparation II: The Spiral**
Any spreads which are good on _Toast Variations_ are good on wraps. If you
put a line of hummus down the centre of the wrap and then add bulky items
like lettuce and rice, you can roll it into a wrap. But what if all you want in
your wrap _is_ the spread? Fear not, brave Reader! Spread it all over one side of
the wrap, then roll it into a spiral.

< Hummus

< Butter or margarine

< Peanut butter

< Jam

< Peanut butter and jam

< Other spreads

**Mid-Tier: Breakfast Burrito**
A Canadian classic, good at all times of the day.
