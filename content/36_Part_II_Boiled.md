**Core Ingredients**
- Potato

**Preparation I: Boiled Potatoes on the Stove**
- You could boil a whole potato, but it will take a really long time.

- It’s much faster if you chop the potato into chunks.

- Boil the chunks in a pot of water on the stove until squishy.

- Top as described in _Potato Variations Part I: “Baked.”_

**Preparation II: Russian Construction-Worker Potatoes**
This is a microwave version of boiled potatoes. It is named in honour of the
man who taught it to us.

- Cut potato into chunks.

- Put potato chunks in a bowl with a wee bit of water (like a tablespoon or
two) at the bottom of the bowl).

- Microwave until edible. Probably the same 7–10 minutes range.

- Add salt.

- Add butter or margarine.

- Stir and eat.
