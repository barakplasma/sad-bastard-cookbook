title = "Roasted Vegetables"

**Core Ingredients**
- Vegetables that can be roasted. _Root vegetables work particularly well! We
recommend potatoes, carrots, parsnips, squash, celery root, onions (red tastes
best but yellow is cheapest) and sweet potato._

- Cooking oil

- Salt

**Preparation**
- Cut vegetables to roughly the same size. They can be basically any size,
but we recommend about the size of your thumb. _Though thumbs can also
be any size._

- Put cut vegetables on the baking sheet.

- Pour some oil on.

- Sprinkle some salt on.

- Mix it around with a spoon or your hand so they all get some oil.

- Put in the oven at 350°F or 175°C.

- Cook for 20 minutes. _Set a timer so they don’t burn while you’re back in bed._

- If it doesn’t seem done, give them another 10 minutes, and check again.

**Variations: Vegetables**
- Potatoes

- Sweet potatoes

- Vegetarian sausages. _These are technically not vegetables, but they are often
made from vegetables._

- Bell peppers

- Broccoli

- Canned beans. Chickpeas or fava are great here.

- Cherry tomatoes

them from the can. Do

- Brussels sprouts

- Zucchini

- Cauliflower

**Variations: Other**
- Add spices along with the salt.

- Serve on cooked _Pasta._

- Put a fried egg (recipe from _The Humble Egg_ ) on top.

- Crumble some feta cheese on top. Other cheeses work too.

- Use a dollop of hummus as a dipping sauce.
