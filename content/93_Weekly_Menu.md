## Weekly Menu

Meal planning is a lot of work, and most of the time I can’t manage to eat
three meals a day. I sometimes buy a big box of energy bars and eat them for
breakfast, but most of the time my breakfast is coffee. Is that healthy? Ehhh.
I’ve lived to middle age like this.

My life is additionally complicated by a peanut butter ban in my workplace,
so I generally substitute cashew or almond butter for the peanut butter.
